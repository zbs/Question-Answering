<TEXT>     The sky was cloudy after a morning of rain. The weather made the launch
five minutes late.;    The rockets burned for two minutes and dropped empty
into the Atlantic about 130 miles downrange, where ships were waiting to pick
them up. The 100-ton shuttle reached orbit 6 1/2 minutes later on the thrust
of its three main engines.;    Except for the failure of one of several
thrusters during ascent, a minor problem that was not expected to affect the
flight, "all systems aboard Atlantis appear to be performing exceptionally
well," said Mission Control's Jeff Carr.;    It was the 39th launch of a
shuttle and the first of 1991, after a hiatus of four months. Gone were
worries over tiny cracks in a door-opening mechanism of Atlantis that had
grounded another shuttle. The two doors on the belly of the orbiter shut
tightly after the fuel tank dropped off, Carr said.;    The main event of the
flight, which will last five days, is the release of the Gamma Ray
Observatory. Mission Cmdr. Steve Nagel and his crew of four will place the
spacecraft in a 279-mile-high orbit on Sunday.;    On Monday, astronauts Jerry
Ross and Jay Apt are scheduled to take the first space walk by Americans in
more than five years. They are to spend six hours in the open cargo bay
testing equipment that would be needed to build a space station.;    Also
during the mission, pilot Kenneth Cameron and other astronauts will use a ham
radio to contact schoolchildren and other amateur radio operators around the
world. They also hope to reach cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station
Mir.;    The 17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory, the heaviest science satellite ever
lifted by a shuttle, will circle the Earth for at least two years in its quest
for gamma rays.;    "The study of gamma rays opens a new window not only to
the universe but to a whole new realm of physical activities," said Charles
Pellerin, director of NASA's astrophysics division.;    "You have the real
possibility of seeing phenomena that have not been observed before and perhaps
have not been imagined before," NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk said.;   
The Gamma Ray Observatory, known as GRO, is the second in NASA's series of
Great Observatories. The first is the Hubble Space Telescope, which was placed
in orbit last April to examine visible light from objects billions of years
old.;    While the Hubble does its work in the relatively narrow bands of the
visible spectrum, gathering light that originated billions of years ago, the
GRO operates at the extreme far end -- beyond ultraviolet and X-rays.;    In
that range, it monitors energies ranging from 20,000 to more than 30 billion
electron volts. Gamma rays are born often in cataclysms that flourish in black
holes, quasars, pulsars and supernova explosions.;    The rays do not
penetrate Earth's atmosphere. If they did, the sky would be a flashing,
violent sight.;    Unlike Hubble, the Gamma Ray Observatory has no mirrors. A
shuttle mission is scheduled in 1993 to fix a flaw in Hubble's mirror, which
was not discovered until the telescope was in orbit.;    The $617 million
gamma ray probe consists of four scientific instruments, three of them
Volkswagen-sized. Massive devices are needed to collect the rare, sporadically
occurring gamma rays.  </TEXT>

thrusters during ascent, a minor problem that was not expected to affect the
flight, "all systems aboard Atlantis appear to be performing exceptionally
well," said Mission Control's Jeff Carr.;    It was the 39th launch of a
shuttle and the first of 1991, after a hiatus of four months. Gone were
worries over tiny cracks in a door-opening mechanism of Atlantis that had
grounded another shuttle. The two doors on the belly of the orbiter shut
tightly after the fuel tank dropped off, Carr said.;    The main event of the
flight, which will last five days, is the release of the Gamma Ray
Observatory. Mission Cmdr. Steve Nagel and his crew of four will place the
spacecraft in a 279-mile-high orbit on Sunday.;    On Monday, astronauts Jerry
Ross and Jay Apt are scheduled to take the first space walk by Americans in
more than five years. They are to spend six hours in the open cargo bay
testing equipment that would be needed to build a space station.;    Also
during the mission, pilot Kenneth Cameron and other astronauts will use a ham
radio to contact schoolchildren and other amateur radio operators around the
world. They also hope to reach cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station
Mir.;    The 17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory, the heaviest science satellite ever
lifted by a shuttle, will circle the Earth for at least two years in its quest
for gamma rays.;    "The study of gamma rays opens a new window not only to
the universe but to a whole new realm of physical activities," said Charles
Pellerin, director of NASA's astrophysics division.;    "You have the real
possibility of seeing phenomena that have not been observed before and perhaps
have not been imagined before," NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk said.;   
The Gamma Ray Observatory, known as GRO, is the second in NASA's series of
Great Observatories. The first is the Hubble Space Telescope, which was placed
in orbit last April to examine visible light from objects billions of years
old.;    While the Hubble does its work in the relatively narrow bands of the
visible spectrum, gathering light that originated billions of years ago, the
GRO operates at the extreme far end -- beyond ultraviolet and X-rays.;    In
that range, it monitors energies ranging from 20,000 to more than 30 billion
electron volts. Gamma rays are born often in cataclysms that flourish in black
holes, quasars, pulsars and supernova explosions.;    The rays do not
penetrate Earth's atmosphere. If they did, the sky would be a flashing,
violent sight.;    Unlike Hubble, the Gamma Ray Observatory has no mirrors. A
shuttle mission is scheduled in 1993 to fix a flaw in Hubble's mirror, which
was not discovered until the telescope was in orbit.;    The $617 million
gamma ray probe consists of four scientific instruments, three of them
Volkswagen-sized. Massive devices are needed to collect the rare, sporadically
occurring gamma rays.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The sky was cloudy after a morning of rain. The weather made the launch
five minutes late.;    The rockets burned for two minutes and dropped empty
into the Atlantic about 130 miles downrange, where ships were waiting to pick
them up. The 100-ton shuttle reached orbit 6 1/2 minutes later on the thrust
of its three main engines.;    Except for the failure of one of several
thrusters during ascent, a minor problem that was not expected to affect the
flight, "all systems aboard Atlantis appear to be performing exceptionally
well," said Mission Control's Jeff Carr.;    It was the 39th launch of a
shuttle and the first of 1991, after a hiatus of four months. Gone were
worries over tiny cracks in a door-opening mechanism of Atlantis that had
grounded another shuttle. The two doors on the belly of the orbiter shut
tightly after the fuel tank dropped off, Carr said.;    The main event of the
flight, which will last five days, is the release of the Gamma Ray
Observatory. Mission Cmdr. Steve Nagel and his crew of four will place the
spacecraft in a 279-mile-high orbit on Sunday.;    On Monday, astronauts Jerry
Ross and Jay Apt are scheduled to take the first space walk by Americans in
more than five years. They are to spend six hours in the open cargo bay
testing equipment that would be needed to build a space station.;    Also
during the mission, pilot Kenneth Cameron and other astronauts will use a ham
radio to contact schoolchildren and other amateur radio operators around the
world. They also hope to reach cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station
Mir.;    The 17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory, the heaviest science satellite ever
lifted by a shuttle, will circle the Earth for at least two years in its quest
for gamma rays.;    "The study of gamma rays opens a new window not only to
the universe but to a whole new realm of physical activities," said Charles
Pellerin, director of NASA's astrophysics division.;    "You have the real
possibility of seeing phenomena that have not been observed before and perhaps
have not been imagined before," NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk said.;   
The Gamma Ray Observatory, known as GRO, is the second in NASA's series of
Great Observatories. The first is the Hubble Space Telescope, which was placed
in orbit last April to examine visible light from objects billions of years
old.;    While the Hubble does its work in the relatively narrow bands of the
visible spectrum, gathering light that originated billions of years ago, the
GRO operates at the extreme far end -- beyond ultraviolet and X-rays.;    In
that range, it monitors energies ranging from 20,000 to more than 30 billion
electron volts. Gamma rays are born often in cataclysms that flourish in black
holes, quasars, pulsars and supernova explosions.;    The rays do not
penetrate Earth's atmosphere. If they did, the sky would be a flashing,
violent sight.;    Unlike Hubble, the Gamma Ray Observatory has no mirrors. A
shuttle mission is scheduled in 1993 to fix a flaw in Hubble's mirror, which
was not discovered until the telescope was in orbit.;    The $617 million
gamma ray probe consists of four scientific instruments, three of them
Volkswagen-sized. Massive devices are needed to collect the rare, sporadically
occurring gamma rays.  </TEXT>

  [Text] Henry W. Anderson, Belizean ambassador to Guatemala, 
yesterday said his government is prepared to begin negotiations 
on the territorial dispute with Guatemala; adding that a 
commission has been created for this purpose and only the final 
details must be settled. 
  The Guatemalan Government has recognized Belize's 
independence; therefore, we have accepted the fact that a border 
dispute prevails between the two countries, a situation we hope 
will be handled cordially, he said. Regarding the 
organization of a Belizean Council, the ambassador said this is 
considered positive because it is a sign the Guatemalan 
Government is prepared to begin negotiations to settle the 
dispute. 
  Belize is interested in establishing trade, cultural, 
and sports relations, not only with Guatemala but with all of 
Central America; and that is one of the reasons that prompt us 
to be prepared to negotiate what is negotiable, Anderson 
said. The ambassador also said he cannot release the names of 
the persons who make up the Belizean commission that will 
participate in the negotiations, because he does not have them. 
  He also referred to the role played by the media in the 
case, 
which is important, to establish the objective atmosphere 
necessary to settle relations between the States of Guatemala 
and Belize. The diplomat added that Belize's recognition as an 
independent state by the media, and the illustration of this on 
the region's maps, will represent a great step forward. <F P=106> [Passages in italics as published] </F>

TRYPTOPHAN: UNCERTAINTY REIGNS AFTER BAN ON SALES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A $150-MILLION-A-YEAR MARKET HAD GROWN FOR THE AMINO ACID. NOW, EXPERTS 
ARE DIVIDED ON WHETHER THE SUPPLEMENTS ARE HELPFUL OR HARMFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there is a golden rule of nutrition, it is a simple one: Too much of 
anything is bad for you. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when it comes to amino-acid nutritional supplements, Americans seem to 
cling more to the creed that if a substance occurs naturally within the human 
body, one can never have too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy resulted in the development of an estimated $150-million-a-year 
market for the amino acid tryptophan in the United States over the last few 
years. Sold over the counter merely as a "nutritional supplement," it 
nonetheless has been used as an alternative drug by many people, sometimes on 
the advice of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The tryptophan boom was stopped cold last week by state and federal orders 
banning sales of tryptophan while officials determine whether the substance is 
behind 287 U.S. cases of a rare blood disorder, 24 of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
If tryptophan supplements are indeed responsible for the outbreak of 
eosinophilia, contamination is a key suspected cause. However, because 
tryptophan has a complicated metabolic pathway in the body, there is also the 
possibility that excessive doses could have built up one or more byproducts to 
harmful levels, scientists say. Tryptophan advocates, who point to years of use 
of the amino acid, say they think an obscure virus is at fault for the outbreak 
of the blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the amino acid really is to blame, the situation highlights the 
rise in a quasi-medical underground that sees amino acid supplements as a 
"natural" way to remedy a host of ills. 
</P>
<P>
Can't sleep well? Eating too much? Depressed? Suffering premenstrual syndrome? 
Try tryptophan, popular books advise. 
</P>
<P>
In training? Try arginine or ornithine to stimulate a "natural" steroid dose in 
your body that will bulk up muscles, the athletes' grapevine says. 
</P>
<P>
Or replenish your protein stores with leucine, isoleucine, valine and 
threonine, the grapevine also says. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the scientific research on which this type of advice is based 
is preliminary at best. More importantly, it was never followed up with the 
kinds of careful studies that would determine how much of these amino acids is 
enough -- and how much is too much. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, critics express doubts about the usefulness of amino acid testing 
and therapy done in Southern California and elsewhere. In some cases, they 
suggest, amino acid supplementation could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But psychiatrist Priscilla Slagle says she uses "a wide variety" of amino acids 
to treat her patients in Los Angeles, Encino and Palm Springs. Among them have 
been "hundreds" of people given tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that amino acid treatment is a frontier treatment, and I believe 
they do have powerful medical uses," Slagle said. "When people have illnesses 
and difficulties, their metabolic processes are disturbed. So we're talking 
about correcting and creating a balance again." 
</P>
<P>
Because she has concerns about quality control, Slagle tells her patients to 
use only products formulated by Tyson &amp; Associates of Santa Monica, which 
markets its amino acids only through doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Don Tyson, president of the firm, said it does about $5 million a year in 
business through "a few hundred" doctors in the Los Angeles area and "a few 
thousand" throughout the United States and in Holland, Italy and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of tryptophan and other amino acid supplements consumed 
by Americans comes not from firms that market through doctors but from 
manufacturers that sell through retail outlets. These manufacturers count on 
popular health books and word of mouth to build a clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Because amino acid pills are classified as nutritional supplements, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration has no controls over their manufacture or sale. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and mainstream physicians have viewed the amino acid boom as 
relatively harmless, since they assume Americans taking the supplements are 
adequately nourished. 
</P>
<P>
But for a marginally nourished or malnourished person, they suggest, amino acid 
supplements might be harmful. Animal research shows that, when an animal is 
getting barely enough of the amino acids it needs, giving it a high dose 
produces illness much more readily than in a well-nourished animal, said 
Dorothy Gietzen, a biochemist who directs the UC Davis psychiatry research lab. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some scientists worry about damage to the liver from having to 
break down unused amino acids and possible damage from accumulation of 
byproducts of the breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the elegant chemical factory that is life, there are four major components: 
</P>
<P>
* The genetic code provides a blueprint for all work the body does. 
</P>
<P>
* Carbohydrates provide energy to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Proteins direct the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Fats store energy for use later. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two different amino acids are known as building blocks in the protein 
division of this biochemical factory. Just as a child snaps together Legos to 
build a thousand fantastic structures, the body strings together amino acids in 
countless ways to make countless proteins. 
</P>
<P>
(Amino acids come in L and D forms -- the L form being the version that the 
body naturally uses and the version most commonly sold. The D form is a 
three-dimensional mirror image.) 
</P>
<P>
When a human lifts a finger, has a thought, or just breathes, it is because 
enzymes and other proteins are causing chemical reactions to make this use of 
energy possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the raw material for this comes only from taking in proteins in food, 
breaking them down in the gastrointestinal tract, and then absorbing the 
resulting amino acids into the bloodstream. Unused amino acids are broken down 
by the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The body needs all 22 amino acids to work properly, and a deficiency in any one 
of them becomes the limiting factor for protein synthesis. However, in adults 
only eight "essential" amino acids -- including tryptophan -- must be derived 
from food. The other 14 important amino acids can be synthesized adequately by 
the body from the essential amino acids. (Babies need histidine but develop the 
ability to synthesize it as they grow.) 
</P>
<P>
Over short periods, the body harmlessly makes up for shortages of essential 
amino acids by digesting protein-rich muscle cells of its own gastrointestinal 
tract. Over long periods or in a marginally nourished person, deficiency 
results in disease, such as pellagra, caused by lack of vitamin B-6, which is 
produced when the body breaks down tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Where advocates of amino acid supplements and their critics disagree is in 
whether it is useful or harmful to try to boost the protein-building process by 
taking amino acid supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, of the Santa Monica amino acid firm, says keeping track of his amino 
acid levels and augmenting them keeps him from getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
Slagle and her patients say adding tryptophan to their daily health care 
rituals helps them sleep better and cures depression. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan is thought to do this by boosting the brain's level of the chemical 
serotonin. 
</P>
<P>
But the same effect can be gotten at less expense and with less risk of 
overloading the body by merely drinking a glass of milk at bedtime, said 
Richard Wurtman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher whose work 
showing the serotonin link helped popularize tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman said he worries that the unregulated use of tryptophan means people are 
overloading their bodies with it and are doing so without knowing basic 
precautions. It will amplify the effects of certain antidepressant, 
hypertensive or antipsychotic drugs, and should never be taken before driving 
or dangerous activities, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan's perceived status as a nutritional good guy provides an interesting 
contrast to the negative image of a sister amino acid, the flavor enhancer 
monosodium glutamate. 
</P>
<P>
The "glutamate" part of MSG is an amino acid and, like tryptophan, is a 
neurotransmitter, affecting the delicate cells of the brain and nervous system. 
It is excesses of glutamate that are blamed for that lethargic, headachy 
condition often called Chinese restaurant syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the same people who worry that a Chinese restaurant is using MSG might go 
home at night and pop a tryptophan pill to help them sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty in determining whether amino acid supplements are good 
or bad is that their various paths through the body and interactions with one 
another are complicated and, so far, not very well studied. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is we know very little about what happens in terms of flows of 
material in the body, especially for amino acids like tryptophan," said Dwight 
Matthews, associate professor at Cornell Medical College in New York City. 
Matthews tacks radioactive atoms onto amino acids and then traces their 
biological paths. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go back to almost any eating studies and look at how amino acid levels 
change after a meal, but there's not a lot in terms of the kinetics -- what 
happens to it later," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Davis, biochemist Gietzen noted that studies of rats show that 
concentrations of amino acids in blood vary widely depending on whether the 
animal has been fasting or has just eaten, the composition of the most recent 
meal, and the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a paper she uses as a reference, Gietzen said there are wide variations 
in amino acid levels in plasma that are considered average. For tryptophan, the 
average range in men is from 30 to 90 nanograms per milliliter of plasma; for 
women, it ranges from 24 to 76. 
</P>
<P>
With that wide a range, how can "normal" be determined, she asked. Before an 
individual's amino acid deficiencies could be reliably determined, she said, 
multiple blood samples would be required over the course of the day, for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had a consistent pattern, you could maybe recommend adding something 
to the diet -- but it would be better to add it to the diet than it would be to 
give it to them in pills," Gietzen said, "because they can tolerate it better 
in a combination with other amino acids than singly." 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials who are investigating the outbreak of the blood 
disease eosinophilia might shed some light on how much tryptophan is too much 
if they find evidence of large doses in people who acquired the disease. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that supplements have been widely used for years is seen as 
an indication that the problem may be due instead to contamination of the 
crystalline tryptophan powder imported from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews of Cornell noted that, for his studies, he has to verify the purity of 
the amino acid powder before administering it to research subjects -- and he 
frequently finds contamination. 
</P>
<P>
"Time and time again I find some very strange impurities," Matthews said. 
"That, in my opinion, is one of the best places to look." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have developed good methods for assuring purity of their product, 
but a change in procedures could result in contamination of new batches, he 
said. In addition, the high price of Japanese amino acids would put economic 
pressure on U.S. companies to mix them with cheaper products produced with less 
quality control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the complex chemical methods used for making tryptophan and other 
amino acids often involve toxic substances such as hydrogen cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about natural foods," he said. "We're talking about 
specially prepared individual compounds. And in almost any case you can get the 
same effect just by eating right. You can pick natural foods that are a little 
bit richer in specific amino acids and get along just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman, in his role as inadvertent father of the tryptophan craze, wants the 
FDA to classify amino acids as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad truth is it probably works," he said of tryptophan. "But I would hope 
very much that the perception that these amino acids sold by the present route 
may be causing big problems will cause us to rethink completely whether we 
should allow them to be sold as so-called nutritional supplements."

<P>
If there is a golden rule of nutrition, it is a simple one: Too much of 
anything is bad for you. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when it comes to amino-acid nutritional supplements, Americans seem to 
cling more to the creed that if a substance occurs naturally within the human 
body, one can never have too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy resulted in the development of an estimated $150-million-a-year 
market for the amino acid tryptophan in the United States over the last few 
years. Sold over the counter merely as a "nutritional supplement," it 
nonetheless has been used as an alternative drug by many people, sometimes on 
the advice of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The tryptophan boom was stopped cold last week by state and federal orders 
banning sales of tryptophan while officials determine whether the substance is 
behind 287 U.S. cases of a rare blood disorder, 24 of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
If tryptophan supplements are indeed responsible for the outbreak of 
eosinophilia, contamination is a key suspected cause. However, because 
tryptophan has a complicated metabolic pathway in the body, there is also the 
possibility that excessive doses could have built up one or more byproducts to 
harmful levels, scientists say. Tryptophan advocates, who point to years of use 
of the amino acid, say they think an obscure virus is at fault for the outbreak 
of the blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the amino acid really is to blame, the situation highlights the 
rise in a quasi-medical underground that sees amino acid supplements as a 
"natural" way to remedy a host of ills. 
</P>
<P>
Can't sleep well? Eating too much? Depressed? Suffering premenstrual syndrome? 
Try tryptophan, popular books advise. 
</P>
<P>
In training? Try arginine or ornithine to stimulate a "natural" steroid dose in 
your body that will bulk up muscles, the athletes' grapevine says. 
</P>
<P>
Or replenish your protein stores with leucine, isoleucine, valine and 
threonine, the grapevine also says. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the scientific research on which this type of advice is based 
is preliminary at best. More importantly, it was never followed up with the 
kinds of careful studies that would determine how much of these amino acids is 
enough -- and how much is too much. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, critics express doubts about the usefulness of amino acid testing 
and therapy done in Southern California and elsewhere. In some cases, they 
suggest, amino acid supplementation could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But psychiatrist Priscilla Slagle says she uses "a wide variety" of amino acids 
to treat her patients in Los Angeles, Encino and Palm Springs. Among them have 
been "hundreds" of people given tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that amino acid treatment is a frontier treatment, and I believe 
they do have powerful medical uses," Slagle said. "When people have illnesses 
and difficulties, their metabolic processes are disturbed. So we're talking 
about correcting and creating a balance again." 
</P>
<P>
Because she has concerns about quality control, Slagle tells her patients to 
use only products formulated by Tyson &amp; Associates of Santa Monica, which 
markets its amino acids only through doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Don Tyson, president of the firm, said it does about $5 million a year in 
business through "a few hundred" doctors in the Los Angeles area and "a few 
thousand" throughout the United States and in Holland, Italy and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of tryptophan and other amino acid supplements consumed 
by Americans comes not from firms that market through doctors but from 
manufacturers that sell through retail outlets. These manufacturers count on 
popular health books and word of mouth to build a clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Because amino acid pills are classified as nutritional supplements, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration has no controls over their manufacture or sale. 
</P>
<P>

relatively harmless, since they assume Americans taking the supplements are

supplements might be harmful. Animal research shows that, when an animal is 
getting barely enough of the amino acids it needs, giving it a high dose 
produces illness much more readily than in a well-nourished animal, said 
Dorothy Gietzen, a biochemist who directs the UC Davis psychiatry research lab. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some scientists worry about damage to the liver from having to 
break down unused amino acids and possible damage from accumulation of 
byproducts of the breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the elegant chemical factory that is life, there are four major components: 
</P>
<P>
* The genetic code provides a blueprint for all work the body does. 
</P>
<P>
* Carbohydrates provide energy to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Proteins direct the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Fats store energy for use later. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two different amino acids are known as building blocks in the protein 
division of this biochemical factory. Just as a child snaps together Legos to 
build a thousand fantastic structures, the body strings together amino acids in 
countless ways to make countless proteins. 
</P>
<P>
(Amino acids come in L and D forms -- the L form being the version that the 
body naturally uses and the version most commonly sold. The D form is a 
three-dimensional mirror image.) 
</P>
<P>
When a human lifts a finger, has a thought, or just breathes, it is because 
enzymes and other proteins are causing chemical reactions to make this use of 
energy possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the raw material for this comes only from taking in proteins in food, 
breaking them down in the gastrointestinal tract, and then absorbing the 
resulting amino acids into the bloodstream. Unused amino acids are broken down 
by the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The body needs all 22 amino acids to work properly, and a deficiency in any one 
of them becomes the limiting factor for protein synthesis. However, in adults 
only eight "essential" amino acids -- including tryptophan -- must be derived 
from food. The other 14 important amino acids can be synthesized adequately by 
the body from the essential amino acids. (Babies need histidine but develop the 
ability to synthesize it as they grow.) 
</P>
<P>
Over short periods, the body harmlessly makes up for shortages of essential 
amino acids by digesting protein-rich muscle cells of its own gastrointestinal 
tract. Over long periods or in a marginally nourished person, deficiency 
results in disease, such as pellagra, caused by lack of vitamin B-6, which is 
produced when the body breaks down tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Where advocates of amino acid supplements and their critics disagree is in 
whether it is useful or harmful to try to boost the protein-building process by 
taking amino acid supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, of the Santa Monica amino acid firm, says keeping track of his amino 
acid levels and augmenting them keeps him from getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
Slagle and her patients say adding tryptophan to their daily health care 
rituals helps them sleep better and cures depression. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan is thought to do this by boosting the brain's level of the chemical 
serotonin. 
</P>
<P>
But the same effect can be gotten at less expense and with less risk of 
overloading the body by merely drinking a glass of milk at bedtime, said 
Richard Wurtman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher whose work 
showing the serotonin link helped popularize tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman said he worries that the unregulated use of tryptophan means people are 
overloading their bodies with it and are doing so without knowing basic 
precautions. It will amplify the effects of certain antidepressant, 
hypertensive or antipsychotic drugs, and should never be taken before driving 
or dangerous activities, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan's perceived status as a nutritional good guy provides an interesting 
contrast to the negative image of a sister amino acid, the flavor enhancer 
monosodium glutamate. 
</P>
<P>
The "glutamate" part of MSG is an amino acid and, like tryptophan, is a 
neurotransmitter, affecting the delicate cells of the brain and nervous system. 
It is excesses of glutamate that are blamed for that lethargic, headachy 
condition often called Chinese restaurant syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the same people who worry that a Chinese restaurant is using MSG might go 
home at night and pop a tryptophan pill to help them sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty in determining whether amino acid supplements are good 
or bad is that their various paths through the body and interactions with one 
another are complicated and, so far, not very well studied. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is we know very little about what happens in terms of flows of 
material in the body, especially for amino acids like tryptophan," said Dwight 
Matthews, associate professor at Cornell Medical College in New York City. 
Matthews tacks radioactive atoms onto amino acids and then traces their 
biological paths. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go back to almost any eating studies and look at how amino acid levels 
change after a meal, but there's not a lot in terms of the kinetics -- what 
happens to it later," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Davis, biochemist Gietzen noted that studies of rats show that 
concentrations of amino acids in blood vary widely depending on whether the 
animal has been fasting or has just eaten, the composition of the most recent 
meal, and the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a paper she uses as a reference, Gietzen said there are wide variations 
in amino acid levels in plasma that are considered average. For tryptophan, the 
average range in men is from 30 to 90 nanograms per milliliter of plasma; for 
women, it ranges from 24 to 76. 
</P>
<P>
With that wide a range, how can "normal" be determined, she asked. Before an 
individual's amino acid deficiencies could be reliably determined, she said, 
multiple blood samples would be required over the course of the day, for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had a consistent pattern, you could maybe recommend adding something 
to the diet -- but it would be better to add it to the diet than it would be to 
give it to them in pills," Gietzen said, "because they can tolerate it better 
in a combination with other amino acids than singly." 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials who are investigating the outbreak of the blood 
disease eosinophilia might shed some light on how much tryptophan is too much 
if they find evidence of large doses in people who acquired the disease. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that supplements have been widely used for years is seen as 
an indication that the problem may be due instead to contamination of the 
crystalline tryptophan powder imported from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews of Cornell noted that, for his studies, he has to verify the purity of 
the amino acid powder before administering it to research subjects -- and he 
frequently finds contamination. 
</P>
<P>
"Time and time again I find some very strange impurities," Matthews said. 
"That, in my opinion, is one of the best places to look." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have developed good methods for assuring purity of their product, 
but a change in procedures could result in contamination of new batches, he 
said. In addition, the high price of Japanese amino acids would put economic 
pressure on U.S. companies to mix them with cheaper products produced with less 
quality control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the complex chemical methods used for making tryptophan and other 
amino acids often involve toxic substances such as hydrogen cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about natural foods," he said. "We're talking about 
specially prepared individual compounds. And in almost any case you can get the 
same effect just by eating right. You can pick natural foods that are a little 
bit richer in specific amino acids and get along just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman, in his role as inadvertent father of the tryptophan craze, wants the 
FDA to classify amino acids as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad truth is it probably works," he said of tryptophan. "But I would hope 
very much that the perception that these amino acids sold by the present route 
may be causing big problems will cause us to rethink completely whether we 
should allow them to be sold as so-called nutritional supplements."

<P>
If there is a golden rule of nutrition, it is a simple one: Too much of 
anything is bad for you. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when it comes to amino-acid nutritional supplements, Americans seem to 
cling more to the creed that if a substance occurs naturally within the human 
body, one can never have too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy resulted in the development of an estimated $150-million-a-year 
market for the amino acid tryptophan in the United States over the last few 
years. Sold over the counter merely as a "nutritional supplement," it 
nonetheless has been used as an alternative drug by many people, sometimes on 
the advice of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The tryptophan boom was stopped cold last week by state and federal orders 
banning sales of tryptophan while officials determine whether the substance is 
behind 287 U.S. cases of a rare blood disorder, 24 of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
If tryptophan supplements are indeed responsible for the outbreak of 
eosinophilia, contamination is a key suspected cause. However, because 
tryptophan has a complicated metabolic pathway in the body, there is also the 
possibility that excessive doses could have built up one or more byproducts to 
harmful levels, scientists say. Tryptophan advocates, who point to years of use 
of the amino acid, say they think an obscure virus is at fault for the outbreak 
of the blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the amino acid really is to blame, the situation highlights the 
rise in a quasi-medical underground that sees amino acid supplements as a 
"natural" way to remedy a host of ills. 
</P>
<P>
Can't sleep well? Eating too much? Depressed? Suffering premenstrual syndrome? 
Try tryptophan, popular books advise. 
</P>
<P>
In training? Try arginine or ornithine to stimulate a "natural" steroid dose in 
your body that will bulk up muscles, the athletes' grapevine says. 
</P>
<P>
Or replenish your protein stores with leucine, isoleucine, valine and 
threonine, the grapevine also says. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the scientific research on which this type of advice is based 
is preliminary at best. More importantly, it was never followed up with the 
kinds of careful studies that would determine how much of these amino acids is 
enough -- and how much is too much. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, critics express doubts about the usefulness of amino acid testing 
and therapy done in Southern California and elsewhere. In some cases, they 
suggest, amino acid supplementation could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But psychiatrist Priscilla Slagle says she uses "a wide variety" of amino acids 
to treat her patients in Los Angeles, Encino and Palm Springs. Among them have 
been "hundreds" of people given tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that amino acid treatment is a frontier treatment, and I believe 
they do have powerful medical uses," Slagle said. "When people have illnesses 
and difficulties, their metabolic processes are disturbed. So we're talking 
about correcting and creating a balance again." 
</P>
<P>
Because she has concerns about quality control, Slagle tells her patients to 
use only products formulated by Tyson &amp; Associates of Santa Monica, which 
markets its amino acids only through doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Don Tyson, president of the firm, said it does about $5 million a year in 
business through "a few hundred" doctors in the Los Angeles area and "a few 
thousand" throughout the United States and in Holland, Italy and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of tryptophan and other amino acid supplements consumed 
by Americans comes not from firms that market through doctors but from 
manufacturers that sell through retail outlets. These manufacturers count on 
popular health books and word of mouth to build a clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Because amino acid pills are classified as nutritional supplements, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration has no controls over their manufacture or sale. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and mainstream physicians have viewed the amino acid boom as 
relatively harmless, since they assume Americans taking the supplements are 
adequately nourished. 
</P>
<P>
But for a marginally nourished or malnourished person, they suggest, amino acid 
supplements might be harmful. Animal research shows that, when an animal is 
getting barely enough of the amino acids it needs, giving it a high dose

produces illness much more readily than in a well-nourished animal, said 
Dorothy Gietzen, a biochemist who directs the UC Davis psychiatry research lab. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some scientists worry about damage to the liver from having to 
break down unused amino acids and possible damage from accumulation of 
byproducts of the breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the elegant chemical factory that is life, there are four major components: 
</P>
<P>
* The genetic code provides a blueprint for all work the body does. 
</P>
<P>
* Carbohydrates provide energy to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Proteins direct the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Fats store energy for use later. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two different amino acids are known as building blocks in the protein 
division of this biochemical factory. Just as a child snaps together Legos to 
build a thousand fantastic structures, the body strings together amino acids in 
countless ways to make countless proteins. 
</P>
<P>
(Amino acids come in L and D forms -- the L form being the version that the 
body naturally uses and the version most commonly sold. The D form is a 
three-dimensional mirror image.) 
</P>
<P>
When a human lifts a finger, has a thought, or just breathes, it is because 
enzymes and other proteins are causing chemical reactions to make this use of 
energy possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the raw material for this comes only from taking in proteins in food, 
breaking them down in the gastrointestinal tract, and then absorbing the 
resulting amino acids into the bloodstream. Unused amino acids are broken down 
by the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The body needs all 22 amino acids to work properly, and a deficiency in any one 
of them becomes the limiting factor for protein synthesis. However, in adults 
only eight "essential" amino acids -- including tryptophan -- must be derived 
from food. The other 14 important amino acids can be synthesized adequately by 
the body from the essential amino acids. (Babies need histidine but develop the 
ability to synthesize it as they grow.) 
</P>
<P>
Over short periods, the body harmlessly makes up for shortages of essential 
amino acids by digesting protein-rich muscle cells of its own gastrointestinal 
tract. Over long periods or in a marginally nourished person, deficiency 
results in disease, such as pellagra, caused by lack of vitamin B-6, which is 
produced when the body breaks down tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Where advocates of amino acid supplements and their critics disagree is in 
whether it is useful or harmful to try to boost the protein-building process by 
taking amino acid supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, of the Santa Monica amino acid firm, says keeping track of his amino 
acid levels and augmenting them keeps him from getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
Slagle and her patients say adding tryptophan to their daily health care 
rituals helps them sleep better and cures depression. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan is thought to do this by boosting the brain's level of the chemical 
serotonin. 
</P>
<P>
But the same effect can be gotten at less expense and with less risk of 
overloading the body by merely drinking a glass of milk at bedtime, said 
Richard Wurtman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher whose work 
showing the serotonin link helped popularize tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman said he worries that the unregulated use of tryptophan means people are 
overloading their bodies with it and are doing so without knowing basic 
precautions. It will amplify the effects of certain antidepressant, 
hypertensive or antipsychotic drugs, and should never be taken before driving 
or dangerous activities, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan's perceived status as a nutritional good guy provides an interesting 
contrast to the negative image of a sister amino acid, the flavor enhancer 
monosodium glutamate. 
</P>
<P>
The "glutamate" part of MSG is an amino acid and, like tryptophan, is a 
neurotransmitter, affecting the delicate cells of the brain and nervous system. 
It is excesses of glutamate that are blamed for that lethargic, headachy 
condition often called Chinese restaurant syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the same people who worry that a Chinese restaurant is using MSG might go 
home at night and pop a tryptophan pill to help them sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty in determining whether amino acid supplements are good 
or bad is that their various paths through the body and interactions with one 
another are complicated and, so far, not very well studied. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is we know very little about what happens in terms of flows of 
material in the body, especially for amino acids like tryptophan," said Dwight 
Matthews, associate professor at Cornell Medical College in New York City. 
Matthews tacks radioactive atoms onto amino acids and then traces their 
biological paths. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go back to almost any eating studies and look at how amino acid levels 
change after a meal, but there's not a lot in terms of the kinetics -- what 
happens to it later," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Davis, biochemist Gietzen noted that studies of rats show that 
concentrations of amino acids in blood vary widely depending on whether the 
animal has been fasting or has just eaten, the composition of the most recent 
meal, and the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a paper she uses as a reference, Gietzen said there are wide variations 
in amino acid levels in plasma that are considered average. For tryptophan, the 
average range in men is from 30 to 90 nanograms per milliliter of plasma; for 
women, it ranges from 24 to 76. 
</P>
<P>
With that wide a range, how can "normal" be determined, she asked. Before an 
individual's amino acid deficiencies could be reliably determined, she said, 
multiple blood samples would be required over the course of the day, for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had a consistent pattern, you could maybe recommend adding something 
to the diet -- but it would be better to add it to the diet than it would be to 
give it to them in pills," Gietzen said, "because they can tolerate it better 
in a combination with other amino acids than singly." 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials who are investigating the outbreak of the blood 
disease eosinophilia might shed some light on how much tryptophan is too much 
if they find evidence of large doses in people who acquired the disease. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that supplements have been widely used for years is seen as 
an indication that the problem may be due instead to contamination of the 
crystalline tryptophan powder imported from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews of Cornell noted that, for his studies, he has to verify the purity of 
the amino acid powder before administering it to research subjects -- and he 
frequently finds contamination. 
</P>
<P>
"Time and time again I find some very strange impurities," Matthews said. 
"That, in my opinion, is one of the best places to look." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have developed good methods for assuring purity of their product, 
but a change in procedures could result in contamination of new batches, he 
said. In addition, the high price of Japanese amino acids would put economic 
pressure on U.S. companies to mix them with cheaper products produced with less 
quality control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the complex chemical methods used for making tryptophan and other 
amino acids often involve toxic substances such as hydrogen cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about natural foods," he said. "We're talking about 
specially prepared individual compounds. And in almost any case you can get the 
same effect just by eating right. You can pick natural foods that are a little 
bit richer in specific amino acids and get along just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman, in his role as inadvertent father of the tryptophan craze, wants the 
FDA to classify amino acids as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad truth is it probably works," he said of tryptophan. "But I would hope 
very much that the perception that these amino acids sold by the present route 
may be causing big problems will cause us to rethink completely whether we 
should allow them to be sold as so-called nutritional supplements."

<TEXT>
<P>
If there is a golden rule of nutrition, it is a simple one: Too much of 
anything is bad for you. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when it comes to amino-acid nutritional supplements, Americans seem to 
cling more to the creed that if a substance occurs naturally within the human 
body, one can never have too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy resulted in the development of an estimated $150-million-a-year 
market for the amino acid tryptophan in the United States over the last few 
years. Sold over the counter merely as a "nutritional supplement," it 
nonetheless has been used as an alternative drug by many people, sometimes on 
the advice of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The tryptophan boom was stopped cold last week by state and federal orders 
banning sales of tryptophan while officials determine whether the substance is 
behind 287 U.S. cases of a rare blood disorder, 24 of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
If tryptophan supplements are indeed responsible for the outbreak of 
eosinophilia, contamination is a key suspected cause. However, because 
tryptophan has a complicated metabolic pathway in the body, there is also the 
possibility that excessive doses could have built up one or more byproducts to 
harmful levels, scientists say. Tryptophan advocates, who point to years of use 
of the amino acid, say they think an obscure virus is at fault for the outbreak 
of the blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the amino acid really is to blame, the situation highlights the 
rise in a quasi-medical underground that sees amino acid supplements as a 
"natural" way to remedy a host of ills. 
</P>
<P>
Can't sleep well? Eating too much? Depressed? Suffering premenstrual syndrome? 
Try tryptophan, popular books advise. 
</P>
<P>
In training? Try arginine or ornithine to stimulate a "natural" steroid dose in 
your body that will bulk up muscles, the athletes' grapevine says. 
</P>
<P>
Or replenish your protein stores with leucine, isoleucine, valine and 
threonine, the grapevine also says. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the scientific research on which this type of advice is based 
is preliminary at best. More importantly, it was never followed up with the 
kinds of careful studies that would determine how much of these amino acids is 
enough -- and how much is too much. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, critics express doubts about the usefulness of amino acid testing 
and therapy done in Southern California and elsewhere. In some cases, they 
suggest, amino acid supplementation could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But psychiatrist Priscilla Slagle says she uses "a wide variety" of amino acids 
to treat her patients in Los Angeles, Encino and Palm Springs. Among them have 
been "hundreds" of people given tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that amino acid treatment is a frontier treatment, and I believe 
they do have powerful medical uses," Slagle said. "When people have illnesses 
and difficulties, their metabolic processes are disturbed. So we're talking 
about correcting and creating a balance again." 
</P>
<P>
Because she has concerns about quality control, Slagle tells her patients to 
use only products formulated by Tyson &amp; Associates of Santa Monica, which 
markets its amino acids only through doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Don Tyson, president of the firm, said it does about $5 million a year in 
business through "a few hundred" doctors in the Los Angeles area and "a few 
thousand" throughout the United States and in Holland, Italy and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of tryptophan and other amino acid supplements consumed 
by Americans comes not from firms that market through doctors but from 
manufacturers that sell through retail outlets. These manufacturers count on 
popular health books and word of mouth to build a clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Because amino acid pills are classified as nutritional supplements, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration has no controls over their manufacture or sale. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and mainstream physicians have viewed the amino acid boom as 
relatively harmless, since they assume Americans taking the supplements are 
adequately nourished. 
</P>
<P>
But for a marginally nourished or malnourished person, they suggest, amino acid 
supplements might be harmful. Animal research shows that, when an animal is 
getting barely enough of the amino acids it needs, giving it a high dose 
produces illness much more readily than in a well-nourished animal, said 
Dorothy Gietzen, a biochemist who directs the UC Davis psychiatry research lab. 
</P>
<P>

break down unused amino acids and possible damage from accumulation of 
byproducts of the breakdown.

division of this biochemical factory. Just as a child snaps together Legos to 
build a thousand fantastic structures, the body strings together amino acids in 
countless ways to make countless proteins.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: ARE PRENATAL VITAMINS ESSENTIAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the National Academy of Sciences recommended, in a report published last 
week, that pregnant women avoid multivitamin supplements and instead get the 
extra nutrients they need from a balanced diet, it came as a great surprise to 
many women. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they would agree to consult with their physicians but believed 
supplements were necessary as insurance. Others said they would outright refuse 
to heed the advice, which they viewed as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"I take a prenatal vitamin, plus extra calcium and iron supplements," said 
Aimee Oswald, a medical receptionist whose baby is due in November, "because 
sometimes you can't eat all the right foods. When you're sick you have to eat 
what looks good to you. . .sometimes I have a hard time just getting crackers 
down. I refuse to give mine (vitamins) up. I need them." 
</P>
<P>
This reaction to the recommendations of the 11-member panel of medical and 
nutrition experts and an auxiliary committee of specialists is not unusual. 
Since obstetricians commonly prescribe prenatal vitamins to expectant mothers 
to ensure nutritional adequacy, many people believe the pills are essential for 
delivery of a healthy baby. 
</P>
<P>
Some research has even shown that those women who take multivitamin supplements 
containing folic acid around the time of conception have a reduced chance of 
having a baby with a defect of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
This birth defect, also called a neural tube defect, occurs when the neural 
tube, a pre-embryonic structure that develops into the spine and the brain 
during the third and fourth week of pregnancy, fails to close completely. 
</P>
<P>
It effects an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 newborns each year. And although there 
is no known exact cause, experts believe the mother's nutritional status and 
other environmental factors may interact with her genetic predisposition and 
increase risk for the defect. 
</P>
<P>
But lacking sufficient evidence of a direct link, the government committee 
concluded that, "there is not enough evidence to recommend a folic acid 
supplement to all women of child-bearing age." 
</P>
<P>
It is known that folic acid has a role in development of red blood cells and 
genetic material in body cells. Anemia can even result when folic acid intake 
is inadequate. During pregnancy the requirement for folic acid (also known as 
folate and folacin) does increase, but the question of supplementation to 
reduce risk for birth defects is "quite a different issue," according to the 
chairman of the government committee. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ordinary clinical sense the neural tube defect has occured almost by 
the time that a woman is aware that she is pregnant," said Dr. Roy Pitkin, 
department of obstetrics and gynecology at the UCLA School of Medicine, who 
chaired the committee. "If she waits until she knows (she is pregnant) to 
institute vitamin therapy -- even if it is effective -- then it will be too 
late. All of these studies that have examined (the connection) have involved 
women who were already taking multivitamins before conception." 
</P>
<P>
The panel did, however, call for studies to determine a relationship between 
multivitamin supplements and birth defects. The Spina Bifida Assn. of America 
last week also made this recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Until all the data is in, the committee said that careful menu planning can 
help achieve achieve adequate nourishment for mother and fetus through diet. 
Food is the preferred source of folic acid and many other nutrients -- except 
iron -- the committee said because most women typically fail to meet the 
Recommended Dietary Allowance through diet. A low-dose ferrous iron supplement 
of 30 milligrams is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Women of child-bearing age are encouraged to eat "adequate" amounts of fruits, 
vegetables, whole grains and legumes -- all good sources of folate. A new U.S. 
Department of Agriculture publication can explain just how much is "adequate." 
</P>
<P>
"Good Sources of Nutrients," lists the top sources of 16 vitamins and minerals 
and dietary fiber -- and both folic acid and iron are among them. It also gives 
information on how to prepare and store foods to avoid nutrient loss, explains 
serving sizes and tells why each vitamin or mineral is important. 
</P>
<P>
"This information will help consumers select a variety of foods that provide 
the vitamins, minerals and fiber they need," said Sue Ann Ritchko, 
administrator of the USDA's Human Nutrition Information Service. 
</P>
<P>
Since folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, it is easily destroyed during 
preparation, cooking and storage, so fruits and vegetables should be served raw 
whenever possible. Or, they can be steamed, boiled or simmered in a minimal 
amount of liquid. Store vegetables in the refrigerator.

Here are some good sources of folic acid according to the USDA. Raw forms of 
some vegetables are not included, because in their raw state they don't contain 
enough folic acid. For example, a 1/2-cup cooked serving of beets contains more 
than the same amount of the vegetable raw. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the term "good source" is based on the RDA of 400 micrograms daily for a 
pregnant woman. Desirable intakes for women, men and children, which are less, 
would be about half. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply 40% of the RDA: three ounces braised beef or calf 
liver, 1/2 cup cooked black-eyed peas or 1/2 cup cooked lentils. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply 25 to 29% of the RDA: one ounce fortified 
ready-to-eat cereal -- depending upon the brand (check the label), 1/2 cup 
cooked spinach, three ounces pork or 1/2 cup cooked red kidney beans. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply 10 to 24% of the RDA: one whole-wheat English 
muffin; one small whole-wheat pita-bread round; two tablespoons plain wheat 
germ; 3/4 cup grapefruit and orange juice frozen, reconstituted; 3/4 cup fresh 
or frozen reconstituted orange juice; one medium artichoke cooked; 1/2 cup 
cooked asparagus, beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, Chinese 
cabbage, cream-style corn, mustard greens, okra, parsnips, green peas, spinach 
or turnip greens; one cup raw endive, chicory, escarole, romaine or spinach; 
three ounces steamed crab meat; 1/2 cup cooked bayo, black, brown, calico, 
garbanzo, lima, Mexican, pinto, white beans or split yellow or green peas. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA package also includes fact sheets on Vitamins A, E, C, B-6, B-12, 
thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, magnesium, copper, zinc, 
phosphorous, potassium and dietary fiber.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: ARE PRENATAL VITAMINS ESSENTIAL?

<P>
When the National Academy of Sciences recommended, in a report published last 
week, that pregnant women avoid multivitamin supplements and instead get the 
extra nutrients they need from a balanced diet, it came as a great surprise to 
many women. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they would agree to consult with their physicians but believed 
supplements were necessary as insurance. Others said they would outright refuse 
to heed the advice, which they viewed as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"I take a prenatal vitamin, plus extra calcium and iron supplements," said 
Aimee Oswald, a medical receptionist whose baby is due in November, "because 
sometimes you can't eat all the right foods. When you're sick you have to eat 
what looks good to you. . .sometimes I have a hard time just getting crackers 
down. I refuse to give mine (vitamins) up. I need them." 
</P>
<P>
This reaction to the recommendations of the 11-member panel of medical and 
nutrition experts and an auxiliary committee of specialists is not unusual. 
Since obstetricians commonly prescribe prenatal vitamins to expectant mothers 
to ensure nutritional adequacy, many people believe the pills are essential for 
delivery of a healthy baby. 
</P>
<P>
Some research has even shown that those women who take multivitamin supplements 
containing folic acid around the time of conception have a reduced chance of 
having a baby with a defect of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
This birth defect, also called a neural tube defect, occurs when the neural 
tube, a pre-embryonic structure that develops into the spine and the brain 
during the third and fourth week of pregnancy, fails to close completely. 
</P>
<P>
It effects an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 newborns each year. And although there 
is no known exact cause, experts believe the mother's nutritional status and 
other environmental factors may interact with her genetic predisposition and 
increase risk for the defect. 
</P>
<P>
But lacking sufficient evidence of a direct link, the government committee 
concluded that, "there is not enough evidence to recommend a folic acid 
supplement to all women of child-bearing age." 
</P>
<P>
It is known that folic acid has a role in development of red blood cells and 
genetic material in body cells. Anemia can even result when folic acid intake 
is inadequate. During pregnancy the requirement for folic acid (also known as 
folate and folacin) does increase, but the question of supplementation to 
reduce risk for birth defects is "quite a different issue," according to the 
chairman of the government committee. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ordinary clinical sense the neural tube defect has occured almost by 
the time that a woman is aware that she is pregnant," said Dr. Roy Pitkin, 
department of obstetrics and gynecology at the UCLA School of Medicine, who 
chaired the committee. "If she waits until she knows (she is pregnant) to 
institute vitamin therapy -- even if it is effective -- then it will be too 
late. All of these studies that have examined (the connection) have involved 
women who were already taking multivitamins before conception." 
</P>
<P>
The panel did, however, call for studies to determine a relationship between 
multivitamin supplements and birth defects. The Spina Bifida Assn. of America 
last week also made this recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Until all the data is in, the committee said that careful menu planning can 
help achieve achieve adequate nourishment for mother and fetus through diet. 
Food is the preferred source of folic acid and many other nutrients -- except 
iron -- the committee said because most women typically fail to meet the 
Recommended Dietary Allowance through diet. A low-dose ferrous iron supplement 
of 30 milligrams is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Women of child-bearing age are encouraged to eat "adequate" amounts of fruits, 
vegetables, whole grains and legumes -- all good sources of folate. A new U.S. 
Department of Agriculture publication can explain just how much is "adequate." 
</P>
<P>
"Good Sources of Nutrients," lists the top sources of 16 vitamins and minerals 
and dietary fiber -- and both folic acid and iron are among them. It also gives 
information on how to prepare and store foods to avoid nutrient loss, explains 
serving sizes and tells why each vitamin or mineral is important. 
</P>
<P>
"This information will help consumers select a variety of foods that provide 
the vitamins, minerals and fiber they need," said Sue Ann Ritchko, 
administrator of the USDA's Human Nutrition Information Service. 
</P>
<P>
Since folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, it is easily destroyed during 
preparation, cooking and storage, so fruits and vegetables should be served raw 
whenever possible. Or, they can be steamed, boiled or simmered in a minimal 
amount of liquid. Store vegetables in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some good sources of folic acid according to the USDA. Raw forms of 
some vegetables are not included, because in their raw state they don't contain 
enough folic acid. For example, a 1/2-cup cooked serving of beets contains more

<LEADPARA>  An engineering firm has recommended a series of improvements to enable the
Golden Gate Bridge to survive a major earthquake. T.Y. Lin International of
San Francisco recommended strengthening the structure and "tuning" it to make
it less prone to shaking. The project is expected to take five years.
Preliminary cost estimate is $125 million. These are among the key quake
recommendations:; (box)Bridge towers: Strengthen the 746-foot twin steel
spires that form each tower, the struts that connect them, the saddles on top
that hold the main cables and the reinforced concrete piers supporting the
towers. Rebuild connections to roadway supports.  </LEADPARA>

The way Jim Sawyer figures it, the collapse of a 50-foot length of the Bay 
Bridge may have begun with a two-cent rivet. Sawyer has made a career of 
designing and examining bridges, and he is sure that the seismic blast from the 
earthquake snapped a row of rivets and caused a patch of concrete five lanes 
wide to give way on the top deck of the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The falling slab pierced the traffic lanes on the lower deck, exposing daylight 
and the chilly bay waters 250 feet below. Two cars wedged by the falling debris 
teetered on the edge of the damaged roadway. Initial reports said some 
motorists jumped into the water, but the Coast Guard said there is no evidence 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
It was a staggering scene, one that framed the disaster for a nation that had 
tuned in to watch Game 3 of the World Series only to see live pictures of a 
stricken bridge. 
</P>
<P>
And Sawyer, a Tampa Bay civil engineer watching on television in Florida, could 
not help but think about the rivets that join the huge concrete panels on the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably a connection failure, right about where the rivets sit," 
Sawyer said. "Chances are it wouldn't happen in a hundred years. Those rivets 
are routinely inspected." 
</P>
<P>
But Sawyer and other structural experts who watched the quake's flattening 
power say it is impossible to examine each joint, each beam and each rivet. 
</P>
<P>
"Truth is you can't go over it with a microscope," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
In time, Caltrans officials will eyeball, photograph, measure and note what 
happened to the failed link of the Bay Bridge and draw conclusions as to the 
cause. And they will undoubtedly ponder why the Golden Gate Bridge, the more 
glamorous of the twin spans that link San Francisco with its bayside neighbors, 
weathered the shake with little more than a superficial crack or two. 
</P>
<P>
One theory advanced by experts focuses on the inability of the Bay Bridge to 
bend or give when struck sideways by the powerful ground waves generated by the 
temblor. As evidence, the roadway collapse occurred along one of the bridge's 
most rigid sections. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge didn't give. It broke," said one structural engineer, who requested 
anonymity because he has a contract with the state. "It was more like a stick 
that snapped than a rubber band that stretched. That jolt may have displaced 
the bridge as much as a foot before that section went." 
</P>
<P>
State highway officials have declined to speculate, saying it is too soon to 
know what caused the bridge failure. Caltrans has spent $58 million since the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake to strengthen and upgrade 1,500 bridges in quake-prone 
areas, including the Bay Area. Among the retrofitted structures was the Bay 
Bridge, where crews retied the bridge decks to column supports, Caltrans 
spokeswoman Lisa Covington said. A second $64-million phase to reinforce more 
than 700 bridge columns and supports statewide should be completed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Some retrofitting of the Bay Bridge has been done, but what sections had been 
worked on is unclear," Covington said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McCarty believes the busted bridge may have had more to do with geography 
than concrete patch jobs. The Bay Bridge, built during the Depression, runs 
east and west, tying Oakland with San Francisco. When the quake hit, it sent a 
powerful ground swell north from its epicenter near Santa Cruz toward the Bay 
Bridge, said McCarty, Oakland's public works director for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge incorporates three engineering styles, with the Oakland side of 
the bridge supported by metal trusses. Unlike the Golden Gate Bridge or even 
the San Francisco side of the Bay Bridge, both of which are supported by cables 
that give when rocked by a quake, metal trusses tend to be more resistant to 
movement, McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the quake's powerful groundswell broadsided the bridge, a chunk of 
the upper deck collapsed, McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate Bridge, which opened a year after the Bay Bridge, was spared 
because it was perpendicular to ground motion. The Golden Gate's roadbed, 
resting in a massive sling of cables and span, swayed with the 15-second shake 
but survived intact. 
</P>
<P>
"A truss bridge is much more rigid, much less forgiving," McCarty said. "The TV 
pictures showed us that." 
</P>
<P>
The section of bridge that failed is over a pier support, and McCarty said he 
believes that the columns supporting the roadway "separated ever so slightly, 
and boom, the concrete gave way." 
</P>
<P>
Moments after it happened, Thomas Kelly was driving his camper on the bridge's 
upper deck, trying to return to San Francisco. Then, as he videotaped the 
confusion among rattled motorists around him, he witnessed a car falling 
through the crevice in the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moment frozen in my mind," said Kelly, an Oklahoman who was vacationing 
in the Bay Area with his wife, Debbie. "One minute the car was there. The next 
it was gone. I really thought we were next. I thought the entire bridge was 
going." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate remained opened, and after several closures to inspect joints 
and seams, the San Mateo Bridge was declared safe and passable for motorists 
fewer than 24 hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Reopening the Bay Bridge, traveled daily by half a million motorists, is less 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
A large marine crane moved into place Thursday below the wounded structure to 
lift the downed section bridge in an attempt to assess the damage. Officials 
also considered spanning the gap with steel girders called Bailey Bridges, a 
World War II innovation to move tanks and heavy equipment across waterways. 
</P>
<P>
It is a temporary fix, at best, and one Caltrans official said rather than 
putting a "Band-Aid on the hurt, we'd like to fix it right." But that could 
mean it will be several weeks before the toll bridge is open again for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"That bridge has done a damn good job for 50 years," said McCarty, a Bay Area 
resident for most of his life. "Until it's reopened, life just won't be the 
same."

The way Jim Sawyer figures it, the collapse of a 50-foot length of the Bay 
Bridge may have begun with a two-cent rivet. Sawyer has made a career of 
designing and examining bridges, and he is sure that the seismic blast from the 
earthquake snapped a row of rivets and caused a patch of concrete five lanes 
wide to give way on the top deck of the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The falling slab pierced the traffic lanes on the lower deck, exposing daylight 
and the chilly bay waters 250 feet below. Two cars wedged by the falling debris 
teetered on the edge of the damaged roadway. Initial reports said some 
motorists jumped into the water, but the Coast Guard said there is no evidence 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
It was a staggering scene, one that framed the disaster for a nation that had 
tuned in to watch Game 3 of the World Series only to see live pictures of a 
stricken bridge. 
</P>
<P>
And Sawyer, a Tampa Bay civil engineer watching on television in Florida, could 
not help but think about the rivets that join the huge concrete panels on the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably a connection failure, right about where the rivets sit," 
Sawyer said. "Chances are it wouldn't happen in a hundred years. Those rivets 
are routinely inspected." 
</P>
<P>
But Sawyer and other structural experts who watched the quake's flattening 
power say it is impossible to examine each joint, each beam and each rivet. 
</P>
<P>
"Truth is you can't go over it with a microscope," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
In time, Caltrans officials will eyeball, photograph, measure and note what 
happened to the failed link of the Bay Bridge and draw conclusions as to the 
cause. And they will undoubtedly ponder why the Golden Gate Bridge, the more 
glamorous of the twin spans that link San Francisco with its bayside neighbors, 
weathered the shake with little more than a superficial crack or two. 
</P>
<P>
One theory advanced by experts focuses on the inability of the Bay Bridge to 
bend or give when struck sideways by the powerful ground waves generated by the 
temblor. As evidence, the roadway collapse occurred along one of the bridge's 
most rigid sections. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge didn't give. It broke," said one structural engineer, who requested 
anonymity because he has a contract with the state. "It was more like a stick 
that snapped than a rubber band that stretched. That jolt may have displaced 
the bridge as much as a foot before that section went." 
</P>
<P>
State highway officials have declined to speculate, saying it is too soon to 
know what caused the bridge failure. Caltrans has spent $58 million since the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake to strengthen and upgrade 1,500 bridges in quake-prone 
areas, including the Bay Area. Among the retrofitted structures was the Bay 
Bridge, where crews retied the bridge decks to column supports, Caltrans 
spokeswoman Lisa Covington said. A second $64-million phase to reinforce more 
than 700 bridge columns and supports statewide should be completed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Some retrofitting of the Bay Bridge has been done, but what sections had been 
worked on is unclear," Covington said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McCarty believes the busted bridge may have had more to do with geography 
than concrete patch jobs. The Bay Bridge, built during the Depression, runs 
east and west, tying Oakland with San Francisco. When the quake hit, it sent a 
powerful ground swell north from its epicenter near Santa Cruz toward the Bay 
Bridge, said McCarty, Oakland's public works director for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge incorporates three engineering styles, with the Oakland side of 
the bridge supported by metal trusses. Unlike the Golden Gate Bridge or even 
the San Francisco side of the Bay Bridge, both of which are supported by cables 
that give when rocked by a quake, metal trusses tend to be more resistant to 
movement, McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the quake's powerful groundswell broadsided the bridge, a chunk of 
the upper deck collapsed, McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate Bridge, which opened a year after the Bay Bridge, was spared 
because it was perpendicular to ground motion. The Golden Gate's roadbed, 
resting in a massive sling of cables and span, swayed with the 15-second shake 
but survived intact. 
</P>
<P>
"A truss bridge is much more rigid, much less forgiving," McCarty said. "The TV 
pictures showed us that." 
</P>
<P>
The section of bridge that failed is over a pier support, and McCarty said he 
believes that the columns supporting the roadway "separated ever so slightly, 
and boom, the concrete gave way." 
</P>
<P>
Moments after it happened, Thomas Kelly was driving his camper on the bridge's 
upper deck, trying to return to San Francisco. Then, as he videotaped the 
confusion among rattled motorists around him, he witnessed a car falling 
through the crevice in the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moment frozen in my mind," said Kelly, an Oklahoman who was vacationing 
in the Bay Area with his wife, Debbie. "One minute the car was there. The next 
it was gone. I really thought we were next. I thought the entire bridge was 
going." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate remained opened, and after several closures to inspect joints 
and seams, the San Mateo Bridge was declared safe and passable for motorists 
fewer than 24 hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Reopening the Bay Bridge, traveled daily by half a million motorists, is less 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
A large marine crane moved into place Thursday below the wounded structure to 
lift the downed section bridge in an attempt to assess the damage. Officials 
also considered spanning the gap with steel girders called Bailey Bridges, a 
World War II innovation to move tanks and heavy equipment across waterways. 
</P>
<P>
It is a temporary fix, at best, and one Caltrans official said rather than 
putting a "Band-Aid on the hurt, we'd like to fix it right." But that could 
mean it will be several weeks before the toll bridge is open again for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"That bridge has done a damn good job for 50 years," said McCarty, a Bay Area 
resident for most of his life. "Until it's reopened, life just won't be the 
same."

   Islanders boarded up their homes and
bought supplies Tuesday as Hurricane Hugo, blamed in at least 25
deaths, swept along the Bahamas after leaving an estimated 50,000
people homeless in the eastern Caribbean.
   Weather officials said the hurricane would begin affecting the
British colony of Turks and Caicos Islands southeast of the Bahamas
chain on Tuesday night. The storm was moving on a parallel course
east of the Bahamas.
   ``All of the islands at some time or another are going to get
some effects (from Hugo),'' said Noel Risnychok, specialist with the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas feared Hugo could drift westward
toward more populated islands, including New Providence.
   That island, which includes the Bahamas capital city of Nassau,
is the most populated with an estimated 135,000 people.
   The government of the Bahamas Tuesday downgraded the hurricane
watch for the central Bahamas to a tropical storm warning. A
tropical storm warning remained in effect for the southern Bahamas,
though it was discontinued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, the hurricane's center was near
latitude 23.8 degrees north and longitude 69.5 west, about 190 miles
east northeast of Grand Turk Island in the southern Bahamas,
according to the National Weather Service.
   Hugo was moving in a northwesterly direction at about 12 miles
per hour with its highest sustained winds at 105 mph.
   Government officials in Nassau were monitoring the hurricane but
had not made any special preparations Tuesday for Hugo, said Bill
Kalis, press secretary for the government's information office.
   Residents were told to monitor weather advisories but could go
about their daily businesses, he said.
   ``They were telling everybody to get the water, the lamps
handy,'' said Dorothea Seymour of Naussau, who has a stall at The
Straw Market on Bay Street. ``We never had a storm here for some
years. We're always hearing about storms, but they never come.
   ``Some people worry, some people don't,'' she said.
   ``Although the indications are that it's going to move east of
the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it
can change direction,'' Kalis said.
   Kalis said residents were gathering supplies in preparation.
   ``The stores have reported brisk sales of supplies such as
flashlight batteries and lumber for boarding up windows,'' he said.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas said Hugo's threat to the
northwestern Bahamas has intensified because of the
west-northwestern drift that the hurricane is expected to take.
   ``This westward drift can spell trouble for the northwestern
Bahamas which includes the bulk of the population,'' said Ken
Lightbourne, chief meteorological officer for the government's
weather agency in Nassau.
   Officials with Paradise Island Airlines in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
said they had not changed flight schedules yet, but were monitoring
the hurricane's path.
   ``We're just keeping a close eye on it like everybody else,''
said Hugh Riesdorph, director of flight operations for the airlines.
   He said the company makes 11 round-trip flights daily from Fort
Lauderdale and Miami to Paradise Island, which is linked by a bridge
to Nassau.

   Islanders boarded up their homes and
bought supplies Tuesday as Hurricane Hugo, blamed in at least 25
deaths, swept along the Bahamas after leaving an estimated 50,000
people homeless in the eastern Caribbean.
   Weather officials said the hurricane would begin affecting the
British colony of Turks and Caicos Islands southeast of the Bahamas
chain on Tuesday night. The storm was moving on a parallel course
east of the Bahamas.
   ``All of the islands at some time or another are going to get
some effects (from Hugo),'' said Noel Risnychok, specialist with the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas feared Hugo could drift westward
toward more populated islands, including New Providence.
   That island, which includes the Bahamas capital city of Nassau,
is the most populated with an estimated 135,000 people.
   The government of the Bahamas Tuesday downgraded the hurricane
watch for the central Bahamas to a tropical storm warning. A
tropical storm warning remained in effect for the southern Bahamas,
though it was discontinued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, the hurricane's center was near
latitude 23.8 degrees north and longitude 69.5 west, about 190 miles
east northeast of Grand Turk Island in the southern Bahamas,
according to the National Weather Service.
   Hugo was moving in a northwesterly direction at about 12 miles
per hour with its highest sustained winds at 105 mph.
   Government officials in Nassau were monitoring the hurricane but
had not made any special preparations Tuesday for Hugo, said Bill
Kalis, press secretary for the government's information office.
   Residents were told to monitor weather advisories but could go
about their daily businesses, he said.
   ``They were telling everybody to get the water, the lamps
handy,'' said Dorothea Seymour of Naussau, who has a stall at The
Straw Market on Bay Street. ``We never had a storm here for some
years. We're always hearing about storms, but they never come.
   ``Some people worry, some people don't,'' she said.
   ``Although the indications are that it's going to move east of
the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it
can change direction,'' Kalis said.
   Kalis said residents were gathering supplies in preparation.
   ``The stores have reported brisk sales of supplies such as
flashlight batteries and lumber for boarding up windows,'' he said.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas said Hugo's threat to the
northwestern Bahamas has intensified because of the
west-northwestern drift that the hurricane is expected to take.
   ``This westward drift can spell trouble for the northwestern
Bahamas which includes the bulk of the population,'' said Ken
Lightbourne, chief meteorological officer for the government's
weather agency in Nassau.
   Officials with Paradise Island Airlines in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
said they had not changed flight schedules yet, but were monitoring
the hurricane's path.
   ``We're just keeping a close eye on it like everybody else,''
said Hugh Riesdorph, director of flight operations for the airlines.
   He said the company makes 11 round-trip flights daily from Fort
Lauderdale and Miami to Paradise Island, which is linked by a bridge
to Nassau.

   Seven people, including a sitting member of the
Bahamian parliament and a highly visible Boston defense attorney,
have been indicted on charges they schemed to launder illegal drug
profits, the government announced Wednesday.
   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury a week ago and
unsealed Wednesday, centers around the activities of reputed drug
mogul Salvatore M. Caruana, according to acting U.S. Attorney
Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan.
   It charges that Caruana made $7.5 million selling marijuana,
then conspired with the other six defendants to invest and launder
the money using ``front'' companies in the Bahamas, Panama and the
United States.
   Caruana He is charged with racketeering and, along with the
other six defendants, conspiring to defraud the IRS.
   The others include Kendal W. Nottage, a member of the Bahamian
Parliament and a former cabinet minister to Bahamian Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling, and prominent Boston attorney Joseph J. Balliro.
   Caruana has been a fugitive on the government's most wanted list
since 1984, when he jumped bail after being indicted for allegedly
smuggling $173 million of mariujana into New England.
   Nottage, 48, who is an attorney, was charged with conspiring to
defraud the U.S. government.
   The indictment accuses Nottage of transporting large sums of
money to the Bahamas for Caruana and executing a false document
that concealed Caruana's interest in the island's Islander Hotel,
which was used to launder the money.
   Nottage's wife, Rubie, 45, also an attorney in Nassau, was one
of four people charged with conspiring to violate federal
racketeering laws.
   Both Nottages are accused of lying about Caruana and their
activities on his behalf to a special commission appointed by the
Bahamian government to investigate drug trafficking there.
   The couple released a statement Wednesday maintaining their
innocence. They said Kendal Nottage simply negotiated a loan to pay
off a mortgage on the hotel he had owned and occupied since 1976,
before he became a cabinet minister. No money was sent to the
Bahamas because the lenders and mortgage holders were in the Boston
area and the loan was arranged by attorneys who did not disclose
the lender's identity, the statement said.
   ``To our knowledge, neither Kendal nor I have broken any law in
the United States or at home here in the Bahamas,'' the statement
said.
   The Nottages have previously stated their innocence and called
the indictment, which has been expected, a political move by the
United States to smear the Bahamas as a drug laundering center.
   A Bahamian with close ties to Pindling was one of 30 people
indicted last week by a federal grand jury in Jacksonville, Fla.,
for allegedly taking bribes to allow Columbia's Medellin Cartel to
use the Bahamas as a way station for drug shipments.
   O'Sullivan said the two cases were unconnected.
   He said the Caruana case also was unrelated to indictments
announced in Washington in what federal officials called
``Operation Polar Cap,'' a crackdown on an alleged billion-dollar
international drug laundering operation.
   The Boston indictment accuses Balliro, 61, and another Boston
attorney, Edmund M. Hurley, 54, of Brookline, of racketeering and
income tax violations.
   Balliro has represented a convicted Mafia defendant on
conspiracy to defraud the IRS. Hurley has represented Caruana on
civil matters.
   Last week, Balliro held a news conference to deny any wrongdoing
and called the charges a personal attack by O'Sullivan. Balliro
demanded a special prosecutor be appointed in the case.
   O'Sullivan called Balliro's claim that the charges resulted from
personal animosity between himself and the lawyer ``a figment of
Mr. Balliro's imagination.''
   The interim U.S. attorney, who will step down from his post
Friday, said he took the unusual step of having the entire two-year
investigation and the indictments reviewed by two independent
sections of the Justice Department.
   O'Sullivan said his superiors found no need to appoint a special
prosecutor.
   Also indicted were David T. Gorwitz, 58, also a fugitive, and
Charles R. Burnett, age 47, a Pompano Beach, Fla., attorney.
   O'Sullivan said the State Department had received help from the
Bahamian Commission of Inquiry, had notified the Bahamian
government of the indictments and would ask that the Nottages be
extradited.
   But in a statement released Wednesday evening, the Bahamian
government said the United States had not supplied any evidence
that couple had violated any laws or provided any details of the
indictment.
   The statement called the indictment an ``attempt to extend
United States' legal jurisdiction beyond its shores into the
sovereign territory of an independent nation.''
   The Bahamian government also questioned the timi of the
indictment, which comesth before Congress is to consider
certifying the Bahamas as a cooperating country in the fight
against drug trafficking.

for allegedly taking bribes to allow Columbia's Medellin Cartel to
use the Bahamas as a way station for drug shipments.
   O'Sullivan said the two cases were unconnected.
   He said the Caruana case also was unrelated to indictments
announced in Washington in what federal officials called
``Operation Polar Cap,'' a crackdown on an alleged billion-dollar
international drug laundering operation.
   The Boston indictment accuses Balliro, 61, and another Boston
attorney, Edmund M. Hurley, 54, of Brookline, of racketeering and
income tax violations.
   Balliro has represented a convicted Mafia defendant on
conspiracy to defraud the IRS. Hurley has represented Caruana on
civil matters.
   Last week, Balliro held a news conference to deny any wrongdoing
and called the charges a personal attack by O'Sullivan. Balliro
demanded a special prosecutor be appointed in the case.
   O'Sullivan called Balliro's claim that the charges resulted from
personal animosity between himself and the lawyer ``a figment of
Mr. Balliro's imagination.''
   The interim U.S. attorney, who will step down from his post
Friday, said he took the unusual step of having the entire two-year
investigation and the indictments reviewed by two independent
sections of the Justice Department.
   O'Sullivan said his superiors found no need to appoint a special
prosecutor.
   Also indicted were David T. Gorwitz, 58, also a fugitive, and
Charles R. Burnett, age 47, a Pompano Beach, Fla., attorney.
   O'Sullivan said the State Department had received help from the
Bahamian Commission of Inquiry, had notified the Bahamian
government of the indictments and would ask that the Nottages be
extradited.
   But in a statement released Wednesday evening, the Bahamian
government said the United States had not supplied any evidence
that couple had violated any laws or provided any details of the
indictment.
   The statement called the indictment an ``attempt to extend
United States' legal jurisdiction beyond its shores into the
sovereign territory of an independent nation.''
   The Bahamian government also questioned the timi of the
indictment, which comesth before Congress is to consider
certifying the Bahamas as a cooperating country in the fight
against drug trafficking.

   The spacecraft Galileo grabbed Earth's
gravity coattails Saturday and arced around the planet on a
fleeting visit home 13{ months into a six-year voyage to Jupiter.
   Taking pictures and exploring with instruments, Galileo used
Earth as a gravity slingshot, hurtling 597 miles above the western
Atlantic, the point of closest approach.
   The encounter, at 12:35 p.m. PST, increased the craft's speed by
11,600 mph, giving it a speed of 79,000 mph relative to the sun.
Relative to the Earth, which is also moving, the maximum speed was
30,721 mph.
   ``Everything is working exactly as it should,'' said mission
director Neal E. Ausman Jr. at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as
the craft flew through Earth's shadow. ``We've had no glitches, no
problems.''
   Project officials said the flyby was a valuable dress rehearsal
for the Jupiter encounter.
   ``Every time we turn an instrument on, we have problems
understanding what we've done to it, and what we probably can do to
the software,'' said Clayne M. Yeates, science and mission design
manager. ``So we're really learning how to operate these
instruments. It's been invaluable for us to collect this data.''
   Project manager William J. O'Neil added, ``Once we do figure out
what they're doing we find that they're operating up to expectation
or beyond.''
   Galileo's looping 2.4 billion-mile route to Jupiter made it the
first planetary spacecraft to approach Earth from space and
provided scientists the first opportunity to look at the world in
the same way as they have other planets.
   Controllers ordered Galileo's instruments to measure gases that
cause ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the atmosphere and study
high-altitude water vapor involved in creating and destroying the
ozone layer.
   The trajectory also allowed scientists to explore the far side
of the moon, always facing away from Earth, with modern instruments
for the first time. The far side observations will occur over
several days.
   Galileo approached from Earth's dark side, measuring its
magnetic field and solar plasma flows, and taking pictures of the
crescent moon.
   Two pictures released soon after the flyby showed a portion of
the near-side of the moon and a cloud-streaked view of central
Australia. Data and pictures will continue to come in as Galileo
speeds away.
   Its path also took it 2,162 miles above the orbiting space
shuttle Columbia.
   Exploration of the blue planet and its moon was an added bonus
to Galileo's $1.4 billion mission.
   The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2{-year direct
flight to Jupiter for long-term observation of the solar system's
biggest planet.
   But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's safety
review after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986
led to changes in Galileo's own booster system that made a direct
flight impossible because its new rocket was less powerful.
   Shuttle Atlantis carried Galileo into orbit Oct. 18, 1989, and
launched it on a roundabout trajectory using three gravity assists
from Venus and Earth.
   The spacecraft flew past Venus on Feb. 10. It will get another
boost from Earth on Dec. 8, 1992. That encounter will be closer, at
an altitude of about 200 miles. The pass will also greatly widen
its orbit around the sun in order to intercept Jupiter.
   Galileo will go into orbit around Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995.
   A probe launched from Galileo five months earlier will plunge
into the atmosphere at 100,000 mph, deploy a parachute and make
measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   The orbiter will continue to explore Jupiter and 10 of its 16
known moons for two years.

   The Galileo spacecraft, racing toward a
close encounter with Earth next week so it can reach Jupiter in
1995, will explore its home planet like an alien world, scientists
said Thursday.
   The camera-bearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to
approach Earth from space, so the Dec. 8 flyby will be ``our first
chance to look at Earth as we have at other planets in the solar
system,'' Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist, said during
a news conference.
   ``It gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as
they've never seen it before,'' Bill O'Neil, Galileo project
manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said earlier.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989, starting its $1.4 billion, 2.4 billion-mile journey to
Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   Starting in December 1995, the Galileo orbiter will spend two
years exploring Jupiter and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe
that will make measurements in Jupiter's atmosphere until it is
crushed by intense pressure there.
   Galileo's route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could
use Venus and Earth as ``gravity slingshots'' to expand its orbit
around the sun and reach Jupiter. It will use Earth for that
purpose Dec. 8 and again in December 1992. It used Venus as a
gravity slingshot last February.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to
make pictures and measurements of Venus and Earth. Data collected
at Venus was stored on Galileo's tape recorder and sent to Earth
last week.
   Galileo's optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost
layer of Venus' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that
visited Venus previously. But Galileo's infrared camera made the
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph
winds in Venus' middle and lower cloud decks.
   Severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was
detected in the middle cloud layer, NASA scientist Robert Carlson
said.
   Studying Venus' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in Earth's atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in
a greenhouse, said Arizona astronomer Michael Belton.
   Galileo also discovered remarkably fast high-energy particles
flowing away from Venus, a surprise because space around the planet
was thought to be placid, said University of Iowa physicist Louis
Frank.
   The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that
sweep around Venus. Scientists played the tape Thursday.
   Galileo will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest Atlantic
Ocean at 3:35 p.m. EST Dec. 8. Galileo was 4.46 million miles from
Earth on Thursday.
   The spacecraft will measure gases that cause ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere, and study high-altitude
water vapor that helps create and destroy Earth's protective ozone
layer, Johnson said.
   Galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from Earth, he added.

   The Galileo spacecraft, racing toward a
close encounter with Earth next week so it can reach Jupiter in
1995, will explore its home planet like an alien world, scientists
said Thursday.
   The camera-bearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to
approach Earth from space, so the Dec. 8 flyby will be ``our first
chance to look at Earth as we have at other planets in the solar
system,'' Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist, said during
a news conference.
   ``It gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as
they've never seen it before,'' Bill O'Neil, Galileo project
manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said earlier.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989, starting its $1.4 billion, 2.4 billion-mile journey to
Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   Starting in December 1995, the Galileo orbiter will spend two
years exploring Jupiter and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe
that will make measurements in Jupiter's atmosphere until it is
crushed by intense pressure there.
   Galileo's route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could
use Venus and Earth as ``gravity slingshots'' to expand its orbit
around the sun and reach Jupiter. It will use Earth for that
purpose Dec. 8 and again in December 1992. It used Venus as a
gravity slingshot last February.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to
make pictures and measurements of Venus and Earth. Data collected
at Venus was stored on Galileo's tape recorder and sent to Earth
last week.
   Galileo's optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost
layer of Venus' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that
visited Venus previously. But Galileo's infrared camera made the
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph
winds in Venus' middle and lower cloud decks.
   Severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was
detected in the middle cloud layer, NASA scientist Robert Carlson
said.
   Studying Venus' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in Earth's atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in
a greenhouse, said Arizona astronomer Michael Belton.
   Galileo also discovered remarkably fast high-energy particles
flowing away from Venus, a surprise because space around the planet
was thought to be placid, said University of Iowa physicist Louis
Frank.
   The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that
sweep around Venus. Scientists played the tape Thursday.
   Galileo will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest Atlantic
Ocean at 3:35 p.m. EST Dec. 8. Galileo was 4.46 million miles from
Earth on Thursday.

   If Ernest Hemingway _ that aficionado of big
guns, feisty bulls, lusty reds and really short sentences _ were
alive today, the pugnacious Papa would be spoiling for a fight.
   The object of his disaffection would be ``The Best of Bad
Hemingway'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $7.95), a compilation of
the best entries to a now-defunct annual competition of Hemingway
parodies. The ersatz Ernest contest was sponsored by Harry's Bar &amp;
American Grill, whose ingenious milking of an extremely tenuous
Hemingway connection deserves induction into the Publicists' Hall
of Fame.
   Hemingway, who would have been 90 on July 21, was no stranger to
parody. His second novel, ``The Torrents of Spring,'' was a cruel
mimickry of Sherwood Anderson, an early mentor Hemingway thought
was washed up. But when his own prose became well enough known to
be parodied, Hemingway was hardly a sport.
   ``The parody is the last refuge of the frustrated writer,'' he
said after E.B. White spoofed him with a piece called ``Across the
Street and Into the Grill.'' ``The greater the work of literature,
the easier the parody. The step up from writing parodies is writing
on the wall above the urinal.''
   All of the Ernie-wannabees in this collection are long on puns
and short on commas. Among the titles: ``The Snooze of
Kilimanjaro,'' ``In Another Contra,'' ``Hills Like White
Heffalumps,'' ``The Old Man and the Seal,'' ``A Clean Well-Sighted
Ace,'' ``A Lean Well-Tighted Space'' and ``A Clean Well-Lighted
Race.''
   When author George Plimpton, who wrote the introduction to the
book, was asked in a recent interview to select a favorite entry,
he mentioned Daniel Hardy's ``The Last Good Martini,'' which
mangles more than a half-dozen Hemingway titles in its few short
paragraphs:
   ```Do you want to order dinner?' said Nick. `They still serve
the big two-parted liver.'''
   And later: ```Do you remember George Tell?'
   ```Yes,' said Francis. `He was a swell bowler. For whom does
Tell bowl now?'''
   Plimpton also mentioned the parody by Lee Ewing, ``The Question
Hung in the Air'':
   ``He knew what they must do on this day. It was a month with no
R.
   ```Come,' he said. `It is the day of the running of the
oysters.'''
   Plimpton explains in his introduction that the parody contest
was dreamed up in 1978 by an advertising man named Paul Keye for
Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill in Century City, Calif., near Beverly
Hills.
   The American Harry's was a replica of Harry's Bar in Florence,
Italy. Keye knew Hemingway never went to the Harry's in Florence
but was a devotee of the original Harry's Bar in Venice and often
featured it in his stories.
   His copy promoting the competition warned contestants that they
would have to face ``The White Bull That Is Paper With No Words on
It.'' All entries had to be limited to one type-written page and
had to mention Harry's Bar _ favorably. The winner was flown to
Florence for dinner at the other Harry's (lodging was not included).
   The thousands of entries that poured in took the contest
organizers by surprise, and the contest grew bigger every year,
with celebrity judges such as Plimpton, novelist Joseph Wambaugh,
science fiction writer Ray Bradbury and Jack Hemingway, the
author's son. Television crews gathered for the reading of the
winning entry. Harry's decided to end the competition after a
decade because it was devoting more time to running it than its
restaurants.
   Plimpton was asked what he looked for when he judged the entries.
   ``It has to be funny; it has to echo the style of author. I
think the skill in copying the primary source would be utmust, then
the imagination in developing the idea,'' he said by telephone from
his office at the Paris Review, of which he is editor.
   In later years the entries were pre-screened and the judges read
only the best entries.
   ``The Best of Bad Hemingway'' is rounded out by spoofs of the
author by well-known writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Raymond Chandler and Plimpton himself, whose ``The Snows of
Studiofiftyfour'' is a skillful mutation of Hemingway's writing
style and a Truman Capote-esque sensibility.
   Gary Piepenbrink, who edited the collection for Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, said he thought the book was fairly evenly divided
between those who parodied Hemingway because they loved him and
those who did it because they reviled him.
   Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in
1954, put a shotgun in his mouth and committed suicide in 1961.
   ``He's a literary force that everyone will have reckoned with
somehow,'' said Piepenbrink in a telephone interview from his San
Diego office. ``His stature is not to be challenged. His place is
secure in modern literature.
   ``I don't think the collection diminishes Hemingway,'' said
Piepenbrink, who reveres the author. ``Some of the parodies are
pretty cruel, but he can take it. A lesser writer couldn't endure
all these punches.''

   ```Yes,' said Francis. `He was a swell bowler. For whom does
Tell bowl now?'''
   Plimpton also mentioned the parody by Lee Ewing, ``The Question
Hung in the Air'':
   ``He knew what they must do on this day. It was a month with no
R.
   ```Come,' he said. `It is the day of the running of the
oysters.'''
   Plimpton explains in his introduction that the parody contest
was dreamed up in 1978 by an advertising man named Paul Keye for
Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill in Century City, Calif., near Beverly
Hills.
   The American Harry's was a replica of Harry's Bar in Florence,
Italy. Keye knew Hemingway never went to the Harry's in Florence
but was a devotee of the original Harry's Bar in Venice and often
featured it in his stories.
   His copy promoting the competition warned contestants that they
would have to face ``The White Bull That Is Paper With No Words on
It.'' All entries had to be limited to one type-written page and
had to mention Harry's Bar _ favorably. The winner was flown to
Florence for dinner at the other Harry's (lodging was not included).
   The thousands of entries that poured in took the contest
organizers by surprise, and the contest grew bigger every year,
with celebrity judges such as Plimpton, novelist Joseph Wambaugh,
science fiction writer Ray Bradbury and Jack Hemingway, the
author's son. Television crews gathered for the reading of the
winning entry. Harry's decided to end the competition after a
decade because it was devoting more time to running it than its
restaurants.
   Plimpton was asked what he looked for when he judged the entries.
   ``It has to be funny; it has to echo the style of author. I
think the skill in copying the primary source would be utmust, then
the imagination in developing the idea,'' he said by telephone from
his office at the Paris Review, of which he is editor.
   In later years the entries were pre-screened and the judges read
only the best entries.
   ``The Best of Bad Hemingway'' is rounded out by spoofs of the
author by well-known writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Raymond Chandler and Plimpton himself, whose ``The Snows of
Studiofiftyfour'' is a skillful mutation of Hemingway's writing
style and a Truman Capote-esque sensibility.
   Gary Piepenbrink, who edited the collection for Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, said he thought the book was fairly evenly divided
between those who parodied Hemingway because they loved him and
those who did it because they reviled him.
   Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in
1954, put a shotgun in his mouth and committed suicide in 1961.
   ``He's a literary force that everyone will have reckoned with
somehow,'' said Piepenbrink in a telephone interview from his San
Diego office. ``His stature is not to be challenged. His place is
secure in modern literature.
   ``I don't think the collection diminishes Hemingway,'' said
Piepenbrink, who reveres the author. ``Some of the parodies are
pretty cruel, but he can take it. A lesser writer couldn't endure
all these punches.''

   If Ernest Hemingway _ that aficionado of big
guns, feisty bulls, lusty reds and really short sentences _ were
alive today, the pugnacious Papa would be spoiling for a fight.
   The object of his disaffection would be ``The Best of Bad
Hemingway'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $7.95), a compilation of
the best entries to a now-defunct annual competition of Hemingway
parodies. The ersatz Ernest contest was sponsored by Harry's Bar &amp;
American Grill, whose ingenious milking of an extremely tenuous
Hemingway connection deserves induction into the Publicists' Hall
of Fame.
   Hemingway, who would have been 90 on July 21, was no stranger to
parody. His second novel, ``The Torrents of Spring,'' was a cruel
mimickry of Sherwood Anderson, an early mentor Hemingway thought
was washed up. But when his own prose became well enough known to
be parodied, Hemingway was hardly a sport.
   ``The parody is the last refuge of the frustrated writer,'' he
said after E.B. White spoofed him with a piece called ``Across the
Street and Into the Grill.'' ``The greater the work of literature,
the easier the parody. The step up from writing parodies is writing
on the wall above the urinal.''
   All of the Ernie-wannabees in this collection are long on puns
and short on commas. Among the titles: ``The Snooze of
Kilimanjaro,'' ``In Another Contra,'' ``Hills Like White
Heffalumps,'' ``The Old Man and the Seal,'' ``A Clean Well-Sighted
Ace,'' ``A Lean Well-Tighted Space'' and ``A Clean Well-Lighted
Race.''
   When author George Plimpton, who wrote the introduction to the
book, was asked in a recent interview to select a favorite entry,
he mentioned Daniel Hardy's ``The Last Good Martini,'' which
mangles more than a half-dozen Hemingway titles in its few short
paragraphs:
   ```Do you want to order dinner?' said Nick. `They still serve
the big two-parted liver.'''
   And later: ```Do you remember George Tell?'
   ```Yes,' said Francis. `He was a swell bowler. For whom does
Tell bowl now?'''
   Plimpton also mentioned the parody by Lee Ewing, ``The Question
Hung in the Air'':
   ``He knew what they must do on this day. It was a month with no
R.
   ```Come,' he said. `It is the day of the running of the

BREWER COACH TONY MUSER TENDS TO PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL SCARS AT BURN CENTER

<P>
During his playing career, they used to call him Talking Tony Muser. He was 
non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, and Muser, of Los 
Alamitos, recently took three hours away from a pennant race to do something 
that always came naturally -- make people smile. But this was different. It 
wasn't a laughing matter, and nobody understood that better than Muser. 
</P>
<P>
He was a visitor to the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key 
Hospital. He was there to give, and receive, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows 
about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly 
endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been 
there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place 
in burn units every day. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, 1986, Muser was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the 
Brewers' spring training complex in Arizona. He suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over 55% of his body. He was delirious for more than a week, 
incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly inscribed in his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
That he is a major league coach made Muser a more recognizable visitor to the 
hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hang in there," Muser repeated again and again. "It takes a lot of 
hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. Muser spoke with Mike Lorenzo, 
who is recovering from burns over 80% of his body. "We haven't seen him smile 
like that since he's been here," physical therapist Linda French said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lewis wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he 
knew his accident happened on a Sunday. "My memory fades in and out on me," he 
said. But when he was introduced to Muser, Lewis' face lit up -- and he 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Muser, yeah," Lewis said. "You used to play first base for the Orioles." 
It has been 12 years since Muser finished his three-year stint in a Baltimore 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to Muser and 
wanted to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where 
skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a 
one-hour session with the weekly support group that Muser had the most impact. 
</P>
<P>
He shared experiences with Bill Marshall, Mike Rose, Dennis Driscoll, Tom 
Sparks and Andy Kraft, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related 
crises. Physical therapists Pat Prescott and French, occupational therapist 
Diane Doyle and social worker Gerrie Stancik sat in on the discussion, along 
with Nadine Weinstein, executive director of the Baltimore Regional Burn Center 
Foundation, who arranged Muser's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand," Muser said, "is that we're dealing with people 
who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going 
to understand. People who have been burned are a special union." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, Muser said, was the turning point of 
his mental turnaround. "When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement 
every day, where one day is better than the one before," he said. "I thought I 
was a tough guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can 
be until you go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Muser recalled his impatience during the first weeks of his recovery, when he 
actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for 
my wife (Nancy) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," Muser 
said. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the 
hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs, 
get on the bike and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't 
know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan, 
which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Muser's desire to return to baseball began to dominate his mental 
approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that 
when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was 
in deep depression," he said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what I 
wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Muser credits his recovery to the therapists who treated him, and the unique 
relationship he developed with other patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
Muser said. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing . . . I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a 
macho baseball guy, Tony Muser, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you 
find out how many friends you have. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a 
lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a 
reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
Muser was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I 
don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is 
driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," he said. "The same 
thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane 
crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental 
scars are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for Muser. He 
met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, Muser replied, "You people 
did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key Hospital that day, 
time was worth a few smiles, something Tony Muser used to take for granted. 
Now, he knows better.

"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
Muser said. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing . . . I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a 
macho baseball guy, Tony Muser, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you 
find out how many friends you have. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a 
lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a 
reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
Muser was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I 
don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is 
driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," he said. "The same 
thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane 
crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental 
scars are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for Muser. He 
met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, Muser replied, "You people 
did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key Hospital that day, 
time was worth a few smiles, something Tony Muser used to take for granted. 
Now, he knows better.

<P>
During his playing career, they used to call him Talking Tony Muser. He was 
non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, and Muser, of Los 
Alamitos, recently took three hours away from a pennant race to do something 
that always came naturally -- make people smile. But this was different. It 
wasn't a laughing matter, and nobody understood that better than Muser. 
</P>
<P>
He was a visitor to the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key 
Hospital. He was there to give, and receive, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows 
about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly 
endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been 
there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place 
in burn units every day. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, 1986, Muser was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the 
Brewers' spring training complex in Arizona. He suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over 55% of his body. He was delirious for more than a week, 
incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly inscribed in his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
That he is a major league coach made Muser a more recognizable visitor to the 
hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hang in there," Muser repeated again and again. "It takes a lot of 
hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. Muser spoke with Mike Lorenzo, 
who is recovering from burns over 80% of his body. "We haven't seen him smile 
like that since he's been here," physical therapist Linda French said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lewis wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he 
knew his accident happened on a Sunday. "My memory fades in and out on me," he 
said. But when he was introduced to Muser, Lewis' face lit up -- and he 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Muser, yeah," Lewis said. "You used to play first base for the Orioles." 
It has been 12 years since Muser finished his three-year stint in a Baltimore 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to Muser and 
wanted to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where 
skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a 
one-hour session with the weekly support group that Muser had the most impact. 
</P>
<P>
He shared experiences with Bill Marshall, Mike Rose, Dennis Driscoll, Tom 
Sparks and Andy Kraft, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related 
crises. Physical therapists Pat Prescott and French, occupational therapist 
Diane Doyle and social worker Gerrie Stancik sat in on the discussion, along 
with Nadine Weinstein, executive director of the Baltimore Regional Burn Center 
Foundation, who arranged Muser's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand," Muser said, "is that we're dealing with people 
who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going 
to understand. People who have been burned are a special union." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, Muser said, was the turning point of 
his mental turnaround. "When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement 
every day, where one day is better than the one before," he said. "I thought I 
was a tough guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can 
be until you go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Muser recalled his impatience during the first weeks of his recovery, when he 
actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for 
my wife (Nancy) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," Muser 
said. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the 
hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs, 
get on the bike and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't 
know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan, 
which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Muser's desire to return to baseball began to dominate his mental 
approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that 
when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was 
in deep depression," he said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what I 
wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Muser credits his recovery to the therapists who treated him, and the unique 
relationship he developed with other patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
Muser said. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing . . . I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a

   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- This may be one of the world's
sleepiest capitals. It is the principal city of
Pakistan-controlled Azad, or Free, Kashmir. The picturesque
Kashmir of tourist brochures is the one India controls across
the heavily guarded border.
   But Muzaffarabad is having a small boom because of the
tension between India and Pakistan. Tourists, scared by the
violence in India's Kashmir, are coming here. And foreign

   Kashmir is a kind of looking-glass place: two areas
bearing similar names but controlled by two countries that
view things conversely and whose armies glare at each other
with identical postures of outrage. It is one of the world's
most dangerous flash points.
   India's Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh has told
his people to be "psychologically prepared" for war.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has threatened a war
of 1,000 years.
   It is a potential nightmare for the whole globe. A war on
the subcontinent could go nuclear: India exploded its first
nuclear device in 1974; Pakistan is believed to have nuclear
weapons, too. Even conventional conflict could be brutal as
the animosity between the two countries has been stoked to
boiling point by historical passions and thorny current
problems.
   "There has been a steady escalation in tension and
preparation on both sides," says a diplomat in New Delhi. "We
have a great worry that they're going to get into a war that
neither side wants." The U.S. and the Soviet Union have made
it clear that the support they provided in the past -- the
U.S. on Pakistan's side, the Soviet Union on India's -- won't
be forthcoming this time.
   "Kashmir is a motherhood issue," says a diplomat in
Pakistan. "War could happen tomorrow. It could happen next
month. It could never happen." Says Zain Noorani, former
Pakistan foreign minister: "When you raise the war tempo to a
certain extent, anything can happen."
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, in
1947 and 1965. The territory remains split along the
cease-fire line of 1965 (with alterations made after the
India-Pakistan war of 1971). A former princely state, Kashmir
was given a choice in 1947 to choose union with India, an
avowedly secular democracy, or Pakistan, which was founded in
the name of Islam. The maharajah of Kashmir, a Hindu leader
of a Moslem-majority population, equivocated until
Pakistan-backed troops invaded. He acceded to India.
   India considers this the supreme justification of the
secular state. So, along with its post-1947 terror of further
"mini-partitions," India is determined to maintain Kashmir.
   To Pakistan, Kashmir's accession to India was a betrayal
of Moslems by the Hindu maharajah and a violation of the
terms of partition that created an independent India and
Pakistan out of British India. Pakistan's long-term pledge:
liberation of the six million Kashmiris in India's Kashmir.
   India's tack was to incorporate Jammu and Kashmir state
into its democratic political system, with special
constitutional provisions of autonomy. Jammu is a
Hindu-majority territory adjacent to Kashmir. But politics
proved the undoing of India's Kashmir policy.
   In 1984, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi forced an
alliance between Kashmir's main political force, the National
Conference, and her Congress (I) Party. Kashmiris considered
it a sellout by the National Conference. Corruption spread, a
state-assembly election in 1987 was rigged, and almost
overnight, Kashmir's biggest political force collapsed. The
power vacuum was quickly filled by militants pressing for
independence.
   Last May, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, or JKLF,
the largest of as many as 26 groups, shut down the state in a
strike. Demonstrations and kidnappings by militants led to an
army crackdown in December that continues today. A hard-line
governor was brought in from New Delhi, and he dismissed the
elected state government in February. Foreign correspondents
were thrown out. Round-the-clock curfews made Kashmiris
prisoners in their homes for weeks.
   Indian journalists and foreign reporters who have made
surreptitious visits say India's Kashmir is under military
siege. Tourism, the largest industry, is dead. Violent army
raids against militants are frequent. The number of
casualties is hard to determine. The anti-Indian Kashmiri
militants claim that several thousand of their number have
been killed and more than 8,000 arrested. Anti-India
sentiment is raging.
   "Morally, India has lost Kashmir," says Shafiz Misgar, the
28-year-old leader of the JKLF's political wing. Mr. Misgar
is now in Free Kashmir, which he calls the "base camp" for
the freedom movement. He talks of friends beaten and
terrorized, of Kashmiri martyrs shot down by the Indian army.
He and his friends say there will be no peace in Kashmir
until they are allowed to vote for independence.
   "This isn't a territorial dispute," insists Raja Muzaffar
Khan, JKLF spokesman in Free Kashmir. "The tension in this
region cannot be defused until we are given the right of
self-determination."
   India vehemently disagrees, and the world has accepted its
stand that Kashmir is an Indian problem, or at most a
bilateral one. India applies the label Islamic fundamentalist
to the Kashmiri militants in the hope of alienating Western
countries from the militants' cause.
   India also contends that Pakistan started the crisis by
training and arming Kashmiri militants on Pakistan soil.
Although these accusations come from Prime Minister Singh
himself, India has yet to prove them. In a recent interview,
Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral conceded that his government has
no hard evidence.
   In Free Kashmir, the rebels complain they get nothing but
moral support from Pakistan. But the rebels concede that
Kashmiris were brought to Afghanistan in the mid-1980s for
training with the anti-Soviet mujahedeen, presumably by the
Pakistani military.
   On the big issues -- fundamentalism, independence,
alignment with Pakistan -- Kashmiris on both sides seem
confused. At the very least, burgeoning hatred for India has
made many Kashmiris pro-Pakistan and has boosted Islamic
jingoism.
   When the JKLF spokesman leaves the room after stating that
the fight is for Kashmiris' right to self-determination, his
followers let slip some significant remarks. "We hate the
Indian secularism," says one. Another calls for a
"theo-democratic state." A slogan on the wall of a
Muzaffarabad house reads: "Pray five times daily because this
is the only way through which we can get success."
   The Indian government's emphasis on Pakistan's alleged
training of militants and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism
in Kashmir has helped boost pro-war sentiments in India --
feelings never far below the surface in a country that has
defeated Pakistan in three wars in 43 years.
   In Pakistan, 40% of the people in a February poll said
they believed there was a strong chance of war, the highest
level in a tumultuous decade.
   Many military analysts believe that India would defeat
Pakistan in a conventional war of about two weeks. The Indian
military is convinced of its superiority, and there is a
rising feeling that another war could help finish off
Pakistan's military for good. But in Pakistan, local
politicians and journalists say, the military believes it has
gained strength from new equipment and that revenge for
previous defeats is long overdue.

   The Indian government's emphasis on Pakistan's alleged
training of militants and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism
in Kashmir has helped boost pro-war sentiments in India --
feelings never far below the surface in a country that has
defeated Pakistan in three wars in 43 years.
   In Pakistan, 40% of the people in a February poll said
they believed there was a strong chance of war, the highest
level in a tumultuous decade.
   Many military analysts believe that India would defeat
Pakistan in a conventional war of about two weeks. The Indian
military is convinced of its superiority, and there is a
rising feeling that another war could help finish off
Pakistan's military for good. But in Pakistan, local
politicians and journalists say, the military believes it has
gained strength from new equipment and that revenge for
previous defeats is long overdue.

   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- This may be one of the world's
sleepiest capitals. It is the principal city of
Pakistan-controlled Azad, or Free, Kashmir. The picturesque
Kashmir of tourist brochures is the one India controls across
the heavily guarded border.
   But Muzaffarabad is having a small boom because of the
tension between India and Pakistan. Tourists, scared by the
violence in India's Kashmir, are coming here. And foreign
reporters, thrown out of India's Kashmir in January, are
flocking to Pakistan's portion to meet Kashmiri militants and
refugees from the south.

   Kashmir is a kind of looking-glass place: two areas
bearing similar names but controlled by two countries that
view things conversely and whose armies glare at each other
with identical postures of outrage. It is one of the world's
most dangerous flash points.
   India's Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh has told
his people to be "psychologically prepared" for war.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has threatened a war
of 1,000 years.
   It is a potential nightmare for the whole globe. A war on
the subcontinent could go nuclear: India exploded its first
nuclear device in 1974; Pakistan is believed to have nuclear
weapons, too. Even conventional conflict could be brutal as
the animosity between the two countries has been stoked to
boiling point by historical passions and thorny current
problems.
   "There has been a steady escalation in tension and
preparation on both sides," says a diplomat in New Delhi. "We
have a great worry that they're going to get into a war that
neither side wants." The U.S. and the Soviet Union have made
it clear that the support they provided in the past -- the
U.S. on Pakistan's side, the Soviet Union on India's -- won't
be forthcoming this time.
   "Kashmir is a motherhood issue," says a diplomat in
Pakistan. "War could happen tomorrow. It could happen next
month. It could never happen." Says Zain Noorani, former
Pakistan foreign minister: "When you raise the war tempo to a
certain extent, anything can happen."
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, in
1947 and 1965. The territory remains split along the
cease-fire line of 1965 (with alterations made after the
India-Pakistan war of 1971). A former princely state, Kashmir
was given a choice in 1947 to choose union with India, an
avowedly secular democracy, or Pakistan, which was founded in
the name of Islam. The maharajah of Kashmir, a Hindu leader
of a Moslem-majority population, equivocated until
Pakistan-backed troops invaded. He acceded to India.
   India considers this the supreme justification of the
secular state. So, along with its post-1947 terror of further
"mini-partitions," India is determined to maintain Kashmir.
   To Pakistan, Kashmir's accession to India was a betrayal
of Moslems by the Hindu maharajah and a violation of the
terms of partition that created an independent India and
Pakistan out of British India. Pakistan's long-term pledge:
liberation of the six million Kashmiris in India's Kashmir.
   India's tack was to incorporate Jammu and Kashmir state
into its democratic political system, with special
constitutional provisions of autonomy. Jammu is a
Hindu-majority territory adjacent to Kashmir. But politics
proved the undoing of India's Kashmir policy.
   In 1984, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi forced an
alliance between Kashmir's main political force, the National
Conference, and her Congress (I) Party. Kashmiris considered
it a sellout by the National Conference. Corruption spread, a
state-assembly election in 1987 was rigged, and almost
overnight, Kashmir's biggest political force collapsed. The
power vacuum was quickly filled by militants pressing for
independence.
   Last May, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, or JKLF,
the largest of as many as 26 groups, shut down the state in a
strike. Demonstrations and kidnappings by militants led to an
army crackdown in December that continues today. A hard-line
governor was brought in from New Delhi, and he dismissed the
elected state government in February. Foreign correspondents
were thrown out. Round-the-clock curfews made Kashmiris
prisoners in their homes for weeks.
   Indian journalists and foreign reporters who have made
surreptitious visits say India's Kashmir is under military
siege. Tourism, the largest industry, is dead. Violent army
raids against militants are frequent. The number of
casualties is hard to determine. The anti-Indian Kashmiri
militants claim that several thousand of their number have
been killed and more than 8,000 arrested. Anti-India
sentiment is raging.
   "Morally, India has lost Kashmir," says Shafiz Misgar, the
28-year-old leader of the JKLF's political wing. Mr. Misgar
is now in Free Kashmir, which he calls the "base camp" for
the freedom movement. He talks of friends beaten and
terrorized, of Kashmiri martyrs shot down by the Indian army.
He and his friends say there will be no peace in Kashmir
until they are allowed to vote for independence.
   "This isn't a territorial dispute," insists Raja Muzaffar
Khan, JKLF spokesman in Free Kashmir. "The tension in this
region cannot be defused until we are given the right of
self-determination."
   India vehemently disagrees, and the world has accepted its
stand that Kashmir is an Indian problem, or at most a
bilateral one. India applies the label Islamic fundamentalist
to the Kashmiri militants in the hope of alienating Western
countries from the militants' cause.
   India also contends that Pakistan started the crisis by
training and arming Kashmiri militants on Pakistan soil.
Although these accusations come from Prime Minister Singh
himself, India has yet to prove them. In a recent interview,
Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral conceded that his government has
no hard evidence.
   In Free Kashmir, the rebels complain they get nothing but
moral support from Pakistan. But the rebels concede that
Kashmiris were brought to Afghanistan in the mid-1980s for
training with the anti-Soviet mujahedeen, presumably by the
Pakistani military.
   On the big issues -- fundamentalism, independence,
alignment with Pakistan -- Kashmiris on both sides seem
confused. At the very least, burgeoning hatred for India has
made many Kashmiris pro-Pakistan and has boosted Islamic
jingoism.
   When the JKLF spokesman leaves the room after stating that
the fight is for Kashmiris' right to self-determination, his
followers let slip some significant remarks. "We hate the
Indian secularism," says one. Another calls for a
"theo-democratic state." A slogan on the wall of a
Muzaffarabad house reads: "Pray five times daily because this
is the only way through which we can get success."
   The Indian government's emphasis on Pakistan's alleged
training of militants and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism
in Kashmir has helped boost pro-war sentiments in India --
feelings never far below the surface in a country that has
defeated Pakistan in three wars in 43 years.

they believed there was a strong chance of war, the highest
level in a tumultuous decade.

   Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of
houseboat hotels and Mogul gardens from whose name the English made
``cashmere,'' has become a war zone of separatism and religious
enmity.
   Military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil
servants around Srinagar in these dangerous days, as soldiers and
paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem
separatists in the Kashmir Valley.
   Intelligence officer M.K. Kaul commands one of the jeeps. At the
beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turned
to the four soldiers in the jeep's rear seats and ordered: ``Check
your weapons. Be ready to fire.''
   Kaul settled into the front seat, a 9mm pistol in his right
hand. ``These are bad days,'' he murmured. ``These die-hard
terrorists can attack from anywhere.
   To his men, he said: ``Shoot them if you see them.''
   On Monday, an around-the-clock curfew was lifted from 5 a.m.
until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers. Soldiers in
sandbagged bunkers, armed with light machine guns, guarded main
intersections.
   A spokesman for the Jammu-Kashmir state government said the
situation was peaceful and ``absolutely normal'' in Srinagar, the
state's largest city.
   At least 72 people have been killed since the crackdown began
Jan. 20 in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and
buildings. Most of the dead have been Moslem militants shot by
Indian troops.
   ``We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any
popular movement,'' said Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the
only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority.
   ``We are fighting a handful of terrorists who are determined to
create a law and order problem,'' said Jagmohan, a Hindu with a
reputation for toughness.
   Other officials in Kashmir say privately the situation is
critical, perhaps the most serious threat India has faced in 42
years of independence from Britain.
   ``It looks like everyone here has turned into a fundamentalist
with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become
independent,'' a state police officer said.
   Kashmir was a separate kingdom, ruled by a Hindu maharajah, when
Britain relinquished colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1947, and the
subcontinent was partitioned on religious lines into India and
Pakistan.
   The Hindu king opted to join India, not Pakistan, and the
dispute over Kashmir has exacerbated relations since.
   Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the eastern.
Each accused the other of forcible occupation.
   They have fought wars over Kashmir and the border question
remains unresolved. U.N. observers are stationed on the truce line
and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire.
   Officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to
the Kashmir Valley since Jan. 20, but reports from various sources
indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have
been deployed.
   It is the valley's heavily Moslem population that tilts the
sectarian scale in Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Of the state's nearly 6 million people, 64 percent are Moslems
and 32 percent Hindus. Most Hindus live in the southern Jammu area.
   Srinagar has 150 mosques. ``This is the best breeding ground for
Moslem fundamentalism,'' said a federal official who helps
coordinate the new security measures.
   Nearly every mosque has a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to
prayer _ and, more recently, to exhort listeners to defend their
faith and Kashmir.
   ``The residents are constantly bombarded with Islamic sermons
and are reminded that fighting a `jihad' (Islamic holy war) is the
most sacred duty of every Moslem,'' the federal official said, on
condition of anonymity.
   Electricity was cut off in the city Friday, which was both the
Moslem sabbath and India's national Republic Day on India's
Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating
because militants connected them to car batteries.
   Intelligence reports suggest the government has an advantage
because the separatists are not united.
   The most powerful group is the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
but there are several others, including the Allah Tigers,
Hezb-e-Mujahed Hezb-e-Islami.
   India claims the fundamentalists get money and weapons from
Pakistan. The Pakistanis deny it.
   Jagmohan, the governor, insists the main issue in Kashmir is
economic development, not separatism.
   ``The people do not want violence or the so-called independent
Kashmir,'' he said. ``The need of the hour is development. Let more
tourists come. Let new schools be built. Let new hospitals come
up.''
   As he spoke, military officers waited in the next room to
discuss a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist
brochures call Paradise.
   Right now, Paradise looks lost, at least temporarily.

<TEXT>
   Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of
houseboat hotels and Mogul gardens from whose name the English made
``cashmere,'' has become a war zone of separatism and religious
enmity.
   Military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil
servants around Srinagar in these dangerous days, as soldiers and
paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem
separatists in the Kashmir Valley.
   Intelligence officer M.K. Kaul commands one of the jeeps. At the
beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turned
to the four soldiers in the jeep's rear seats and ordered: ``Check
your weapons. Be ready to fire.''
   Kaul settled into the front seat, a 9mm pistol in his right
hand. ``These are bad days,'' he murmured. ``These die-hard
terrorists can attack from anywhere.
   To his men, he said: ``Shoot them if you see them.''
   On Monday, an around-the-clock curfew was lifted from 5 a.m.
until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers. Soldiers in
sandbagged bunkers, armed with light machine guns, guarded main
intersections.
   A spokesman for the Jammu-Kashmir state government said the
situation was peaceful and ``absolutely normal'' in Srinagar, the
state's largest city.
   At least 72 people have been killed since the crackdown began
Jan. 20 in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and
buildings. Most of the dead have been Moslem militants shot by
Indian troops.
   ``We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any
popular movement,'' said Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the
only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority.
   ``We are fighting a handful of terrorists who are determined to
create a law and order problem,'' said Jagmohan, a Hindu with a
reputation for toughness.
   Other officials in Kashmir say privately the situation is
critical, perhaps the most serious threat India has faced in 42
years of independence from Britain.
   ``It looks like everyone here has turned into a fundamentalist
with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become
independent,'' a state police officer said.
   Kashmir was a separate kingdom, ruled by a Hindu maharajah, when
Britain relinquished colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1947, and the
subcontinent was partitioned on religious lines into India and
Pakistan.
   The Hindu king opted to join India, not Pakistan, and the
dispute over Kashmir has exacerbated relations since.
   Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the eastern.
Each accused the other of forcible occupation.
   They have fought wars over Kashmir and the border question
remains unresolved. U.N. observers are stationed on the truce line
and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire.
   Officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to
the Kashmir Valley since Jan. 20, but reports from various sources
indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have
been deployed.
   It is the valley's heavily Moslem population that tilts the
sectarian scale in Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Of the state's nearly 6 million people, 64 percent are Moslems
and 32 percent Hindus. Most Hindus live in the southern Jammu area.
   Srinagar has 150 mosques. ``This is the best breeding ground for
Moslem fundamentalism,'' said a federal official who helps
coordinate the new security measures.
   Nearly every mosque has a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to
prayer _ and, more recently, to exhort listeners to defend their
faith and Kashmir.
   ``The residents are constantly bombarded with Islamic sermons
and are reminded that fighting a `jihad' (Islamic holy war) is the
most sacred duty of every Moslem,'' the federal official said, on
condition of anonymity.
   Electricity was cut off in the city Friday, which was both the
Moslem sabbath and India's national Republic Day on India's
Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating
because militants connected them to car batteries.
   Intelligence reports suggest the government has an advantage
because the separatists are not united.
   The most powerful group is the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
but there are several others, including the Allah Tigers,
Hezb-e-Mujahed Hezb-e-Islami.
   India claims the fundamentalists get money and weapons from
Pakistan. The Pakistanis deny it.
   Jagmohan, the governor, insists the main issue in Kashmir is
economic development, not separatism.
   ``The people do not want violence or the so-called independent
Kashmir,'' he said. ``The need of the hour is development. Let more
tourists come. Let new schools be built. Let new hospitals come
up.''
   As he spoke, military officers waited in the next room to
discuss a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist
brochures call Paradise.
   Right now, Paradise looks lost, at least temporarily.

Among the keepsakes of genealogists are photographs of ancestors and paper 
certificates, documents and newspaper clippings. However, if they are 
improperly stored, they will not last long enough to be a treasure of 
generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
Attics and basements are the worst places to store keepsakes. Valuable photos 
should be kept where temperature, humidity and light levels are low. Color 
prints are best stored below 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 50% humidity, and in the 
dark. Avoid using plastic storage containers that may contain polyvinyl 
chloride. 
</P>
<P>
Acid-neutral boxes and envelopes are available. If you use envelopes and 
sleeves to hold your photos and slides, be sure they are made of acid-neutral 
paper, or polyester, archival polyethylene, or triacetate plastic film. 
</P>
<P>
Use photo albums with acid-neutral pages and avoid waxed pages. Adhesive tape, 
white glue, rubber cement, paper clips and mothballs or crystals can damage 
your photos. To label photos on the backside before storing or displaying -- 
and all your photographs should be identified with names, dates and places -- 
use a soft No. 1 pencil and press lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Copy old photos first, then store the negatives in a dark place. 
Black-and-white negatives will last a long time if well cared for. However, 
color slides may last only 10 to 50 years, depending on care. 
</P>
<P>
Use acid-free materials when mounting newspaper clippings and other paper 
items. Pastes made from flour and water, wheat or rice are less acidic and less 
damaging than most other pastes. However, they are subject to mildew and 
household pest damage, and may bubble or ripple the item. Linen tape can be 
used for mounting. Find an art supply store for these supplies. Before using 
anything on a valuable item, test each product for any initial staining or 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Photocopies of clippings can be mounted in scrapbooks, but the originals should 
be placed in a dark storage container.

<P>
If you want to know specifically what your antiques, collectibles or keepsakes 
are worth and to document their value, you will need the services of a personal 
property appraiser. Appraisers of antique and collectible keepsakes should be 
specialists. Spend as much time finding a qualified appraiser as you would 
looking for a professional in any field. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have obtained an appraisal, it should be dated, signed by the 
appraiser, along with the purpose of the appraisal and the qualities and 
disinterest of the appraiser noted. Keep the appraisal in your safety deposit 
box.

SILHOUETTING: THE KINDEST CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
ART: AN OLD FORM OF DRAWING, IT MAY EXTEND TO BACK TO THE FIRST SHADOW 
TRACINGS. YET ONLY A FEW CAN MAKE THEIR LIVING AT CLIPPING THE FACIAL OUTLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BENNETT, Bennett is a Southland free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In about 30 seconds, Harry Bryce, the main silhouette artist at Disneyland for 
the past 21 years, can snip the likeness of any man, woman or child out of 
black paper. 
</P>
<P>
The paper portraits of more than 1 million people have been captured by Bryce 
throughout his silhouetting career, and in his Main Street studio at 
Disneyland, the famous profiles of Red Skelton, Goldie Hawn and Cher all have 
been trimmed to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
But for Bryce, the unknown or obscure face is the one that often leaves the 
most indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
"A widow came in asking if I could do a silhouette of her husband," Bryce 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Sure, where's the photograph?' And she said, 'I don't have one, but 
maybe I can describe him to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bryce went to work with paper and scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I made the silhouette as large as I could. I gave him a full head of 
hair and made his lips and nose a little larger than I thought they should be. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I showed it to her and she said, 'Now could you trim this and trim that,' 
and I kept working it down and working it down, until she said, 'You know, 
that's pretty doggone close.' " 
</P>
<P>
But another time, rendering the silhouette of a young man sitting directly in 
front of him didn't prove any less trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you'd call him a dwarf or a midget, but the guy had had some kind of 
accident or some natural impairment on his upper lip; it was literally missing. 
He had nothing but teeth and gums up to the nose area." 
</P>
<P>
Bryce cut out exactly what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"He got off the chair and he shook my hand and said, 'I really thank you. I'm 
so sick and tired of people trying to give me something I don't have. This is 
the first time anybody's ever done me exactly as I look -- and I know what I 
look like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Silhouetting, an old art, has remained popular with the public for several 
reasons. For Jim Griffin of Duarte, Bryce's $3 sitting fee fits handsomely into 
his family budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going to Olan Mills (portrait studio) for a fraction of the cost," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the $3 buys two silhouettes. By folding the 5-by-8-inch paper in 
half, Bryce produces a duplicate silhouette facing the opposite direction. An 
oval frame is an additional $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Barton of Sacramento, whose 8-year-old daughter, Kelli, recently sat for 
Bryce, said she values the silhouette for what she's not getting. "You look at 
it, and you fill in what you can't see. That's the beauty of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Bryce: "Silhouette cutting is to photography what radio is to TV; 
frankly, some things are better left to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland may be the only place in the Southland to have your silhouette cut, 
said Bryce, who estimates that about 25 silhouettists nationwide try to make a 
living at it. But Bonnie Elliott, who began as an apprentice silhouette artist 
at Old Towne Mall in Torrance 17 years ago and now works part time as a 
silhouette cutter at Disneyland, thinks the number may be closer to 250. Both 
artists know of no other operating silhouette studio in the greater Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
That Disneyland has one of the few surviving silhouette studios attests to the 
vision of founder Walt Disney, who frequently referred to "shadow drawing" as 
the origin of all art forms, said Bryce. 
</P>
<P>
"He imagined -- and it's only a guess -- that prehistoric (people) probably 
drew their first pictures by tracing their shadows on the wall," said Bryce. 
That is basically "what we're doing now, except we don't use the shadow, we 
just use the (facial) outline." 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Hickman, in her book "Silhouettes" (Walker and Co.), cites examples of 
black profiles on Etruscan pottery and Egyptian murals as evidence that humans 
have made shadow portraits since the dawn of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The word silhouette to describe a shadow portrait, she writes, is comparatively 
modern, coined in the 19th Century from the name of Etienne de Silhouette 
(1709-67), a frugal French controller-general whose favorite pastime was the 
cutting of profiles from black paper. De Silhouette did not invent the art, 
Hickman writes, but his name was applied to it derisively by those who 
considered profiles in miniature a cheap imitation of art. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of the public, however, silhouettes were inexpensive mementos to be 
exchanged as freely as snapshots are today. 
</P>
<P>
Giving further impetus to shadow portraits was the publication between 1775 and 
1778 of Johann Casper Lavater's "Essay on Physiognomy Calculated to Extend the 
Knowledge and Love of Mankind." In the 34-pound leather-bound tome, Lavater 
argued that plain black profiles were the most penetrating guide to character 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
Although weighty reading, the book was illustrated with several silhouettes 
and, consequently, people rushed to have their profiles drawn in hope of 
deciphering their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hickman, Lavater -- with the assistance of the German poet Goethe, 
himself an amateur profilist -- invented a special silhouette chair designed to 
keep the subject's head rigid. 
</P>
<P>
But not all silhouettes were rapid impressions cut from paper. Just as often, 
silhouettes were painted on ovals of chalk-like plaster, on the reverse sides 
of convex glass and on cards. Portrait silhouettes also decorated fine china 
and expensive jewelry, including rings, brooches, bracelets, lockets, tie-pins, 
card cases and snuff boxes. 
</P>
<P>
In America, traveling profilists usually painted on cards or cut with scissors, 
because transporting breakable plaster and glass by horse was too risky, 
Hickman writes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these limitations, one of the first visiting silhouette artists to 
America, English Maj. John Andre (1751-81), cut profiles of Benjamin Franklin 
and George Washington. (Andre later became embroiled in the treacheries of 
Benedict Arnold and was executed after his capture by American forces.) 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of photography in the 1850s, the demand for silhouettes 
declined. Similarly, the introduction of gas and electricity contributed to the 
disappearance of silhouette making as a hobby because, Hickman notes, "modern 
overhead lighting banished the deep shadows which amateur profilists had found 
so invitingly thrown on walls by lamp and candlelight." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bryce, Elliott and other practitioners of the art of silhouette rely on 
both the artistic and entertainment values of their craft to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a nickel for every time people used the word 'amazing' to describe 
what I do, I'd be a wealthy person," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce has cut as many as 503 impressions in a single day; Elliott once did 472. 
As artists on commission, they receive a percentage of each one. When his work 
schedule at Disneyland permits, Bryce cuts silhouettes at birthdays, bar 
mitzvahs, weddings, graduations and proms, charging $85 an hour with a two-hour 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce said he also would like to teach a class on silhouetting at a community 
college because "the art of silhouette cutting is dying out and there's 
virtually no one around to teach it." 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors to their Disneyland studio are surprised to learn that Bryce and 
Elliott use only paper and scissors and not special effects to produce 
silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to see a big light projecting a shadow on a wall or screen," said 
Lisa Casco, a 21-year-old college student from Phoenix, Ariz., who recently 
visited Disneyland. "I thought they would trace my outline and fill it in with 
chalk or charcoal -- you know, the way we did it in elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Elliott, who is an art school graduate, Bryce is self-taught and 
maintains he can teach the art of silhouette cutting to anyone in eight to 10 
weeks. In fact, Bryce, who trained the two silhouettists now employed at the 
Disneyland in Tokyo, said he prefers teaching students who can't draw. 
</P>
<P>
"If you find someone who draws, they want to put perspective and give it a 
three-dimensional quality," Bryce said. "They want to add tones and lights and 
darks, but you need none of that in silhouette." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who has cut silhouettes in as little as 17 seconds, compares 
silhouette cutting to riding a bicycle: "You have to develop a certain speed 
and balance; otherwise, you fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott cuts quickly from the bottom up, moving from the base of the neck, to 
the middle of the chin, to underneath the nose, to the eyelashes and finally to 
the top of the head. While bulbous noses, sagging chins and protruding 
foreheads all make the final cut, wrinkles, scars and gray hair vanish with the 
flick of the scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the trick is to keep it all in proportion," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the speed in cutting is to prevent the artist from 
"noodling" -- the temptation to trim or cut more than what the artist sees. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way we're like haircutters," Elliott added. "Once you cut it off, you 
can't put it back." 
</P>
<P>
While Bryce and Elliott may succeed in getting subjects into the studio, 
getting them to take a seat is an art form all in itself. For example, there 
are profile-conscious adults who refuse to be positioned with their "bad side" 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to explain that a silhouette is just one line around the outside of 
their face, identical for either side, but some people refuse to believe it," 
Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Some silhouette subjects feel compelled to brush their hair or apply a fresh 
coat of makeup before posing. "Of course, it doesn't make any difference how 
much rouge or lipstick they put on," Bryce said, "but you can't tell 'em that." 
</P>
<P>
When a man and woman appear in the same silhouette, the man's head usually goes 
in front. "This way I can give more detail to the back of a woman's head, which 
is more interesting than a man's," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Also placed in front in a double silhouette is Mickey Mouse, Bryce's most 
requested Disney character. "He wouldn't fit anywhere else," said Bryce, who 
also can cut Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and the rest of the Disney cast 
from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizable film stars, who rarely take a back seat to anyone, present a 
challenge to the silhouette artist. "Celebrities are very hard to do because 
you know their other expressions," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce's wife is another subject who avoids easy depiction: "I know her every 
perfection or imperfection -- however you want to take it -- so I'm never 
completely satisfied. I'll rework it, then overwork it and start over again. 
It's just very frustrating. It's much easier to do a complete stranger." 
</P>
<P>
And about himself: Was he able to capture his own likeness? 
</P>
<P>
"I hated it," he said.

<P>
In about 30 seconds, Harry Bryce, the main silhouette artist at Disneyland for 
the past 21 years, can snip the likeness of any man, woman or child out of 
black paper. 
</P>
<P>
The paper portraits of more than 1 million people have been captured by Bryce 
throughout his silhouetting career, and in his Main Street studio at 
Disneyland, the famous profiles of Red Skelton, Goldie Hawn and Cher all have 
been trimmed to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
But for Bryce, the unknown or obscure face is the one that often leaves the 
most indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
"A widow came in asking if I could do a silhouette of her husband," Bryce 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Sure, where's the photograph?' And she said, 'I don't have one, but 
maybe I can describe him to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bryce went to work with paper and scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I made the silhouette as large as I could. I gave him a full head of 
hair and made his lips and nose a little larger than I thought they should be. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I showed it to her and she said, 'Now could you trim this and trim that,' 
and I kept working it down and working it down, until she said, 'You know, 
that's pretty doggone close.' " 
</P>
<P>
But another time, rendering the silhouette of a young man sitting directly in 
front of him didn't prove any less trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you'd call him a dwarf or a midget, but the guy had had some kind of 
accident or some natural impairment on his upper lip; it was literally missing. 
He had nothing but teeth and gums up to the nose area." 
</P>
<P>
Bryce cut out exactly what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"He got off the chair and he shook my hand and said, 'I really thank you. I'm 
so sick and tired of people trying to give me something I don't have. This is 
the first time anybody's ever done me exactly as I look -- and I know what I 
look like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Silhouetting, an old art, has remained popular with the public for several 
reasons. For Jim Griffin of Duarte, Bryce's $3 sitting fee fits handsomely into 
his family budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going to Olan Mills (portrait studio) for a fraction of the cost," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the $3 buys two silhouettes. By folding the 5-by-8-inch paper in 
half, Bryce produces a duplicate silhouette facing the opposite direction. An 
oval frame is an additional $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Barton of Sacramento, whose 8-year-old daughter, Kelli, recently sat for 
Bryce, said she values the silhouette for what she's not getting. "You look at 
it, and you fill in what you can't see. That's the beauty of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Bryce: "Silhouette cutting is to photography what radio is to TV; 
frankly, some things are better left to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland may be the only place in the Southland to have your silhouette cut, 
said Bryce, who estimates that about 25 silhouettists nationwide try to make a 
living at it. But Bonnie Elliott, who began as an apprentice silhouette artist 
at Old Towne Mall in Torrance 17 years ago and now works part time as a 
silhouette cutter at Disneyland, thinks the number may be closer to 250. Both

But not all silhouettes were rapid impressions cut from paper. Just as often, 
silhouettes were painted on ovals of chalk-like plaster, on the reverse sides 
of convex glass and on cards. Portrait silhouettes also decorated fine china 
and expensive jewelry, including rings, brooches, bracelets, lockets, tie-pins, 
card cases and snuff boxes. 
</P>
<P>
In America, traveling profilists usually painted on cards or cut with scissors, 
because transporting breakable plaster and glass by horse was too risky, 
Hickman writes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these limitations, one of the first visiting silhouette artists to 
America, English Maj. John Andre (1751-81), cut profiles of Benjamin Franklin 
and George Washington. (Andre later became embroiled in the treacheries of 
Benedict Arnold and was executed after his capture by American forces.) 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of photography in the 1850s, the demand for silhouettes 
declined. Similarly, the introduction of gas and electricity contributed to the 
disappearance of silhouette making as a hobby because, Hickman notes, "modern 
overhead lighting banished the deep shadows which amateur profilists had found 
so invitingly thrown on walls by lamp and candlelight." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bryce, Elliott and other practitioners of the art of silhouette rely on 
both the artistic and entertainment values of their craft to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a nickel for every time people used the word 'amazing' to describe 
what I do, I'd be a wealthy person," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce has cut as many as 503 impressions in a single day; Elliott once did 472. 
As artists on commission, they receive a percentage of each one. When his work 
schedule at Disneyland permits, Bryce cuts silhouettes at birthdays, bar 
mitzvahs, weddings, graduations and proms, charging $85 an hour with a two-hour 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce said he also would like to teach a class on silhouetting at a community 
college because "the art of silhouette cutting is dying out and there's 
virtually no one around to teach it." 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors to their Disneyland studio are surprised to learn that Bryce and 
Elliott use only paper and scissors and not special effects to produce 
silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to see a big light projecting a shadow on a wall or screen," said 
Lisa Casco, a 21-year-old college student from Phoenix, Ariz., who recently 
visited Disneyland. "I thought they would trace my outline and fill it in with 
chalk or charcoal -- you know, the way we did it in elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Elliott, who is an art school graduate, Bryce is self-taught and 
maintains he can teach the art of silhouette cutting to anyone in eight to 10 
weeks. In fact, Bryce, who trained the two silhouettists now employed at the 
Disneyland in Tokyo, said he prefers teaching students who can't draw. 
</P>
<P>
"If you find someone who draws, they want to put perspective and give it a 
three-dimensional quality," Bryce said. "They want to add tones and lights and 
darks, but you need none of that in silhouette." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who has cut silhouettes in as little as 17 seconds, compares 
silhouette cutting to riding a bicycle: "You have to develop a certain speed 
and balance; otherwise, you fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott cuts quickly from the bottom up, moving from the base of the neck, to 
the middle of the chin, to underneath the nose, to the eyelashes and finally to 
the top of the head. While bulbous noses, sagging chins and protruding 
foreheads all make the final cut, wrinkles, scars and gray hair vanish with the 
flick of the scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the trick is to keep it all in proportion," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the speed in cutting is to prevent the artist from 
"noodling" -- the temptation to trim or cut more than what the artist sees. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way we're like haircutters," Elliott added. "Once you cut it off, you 
can't put it back." 
</P>
<P>
While Bryce and Elliott may succeed in getting subjects into the studio, 
getting them to take a seat is an art form all in itself. For example, there 
are profile-conscious adults who refuse to be positioned with their "bad side" 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to explain that a silhouette is just one line around the outside of 
their face, identical for either side, but some people refuse to believe it," 
Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Some silhouette subjects feel compelled to brush their hair or apply a fresh 
coat of makeup before posing. "Of course, it doesn't make any difference how 
much rouge or lipstick they put on," Bryce said, "but you can't tell 'em that." 
</P>
<P>
When a man and woman appear in the same silhouette, the man's head usually goes 
in front. "This way I can give more detail to the back of a woman's head, which 
is more interesting than a man's," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Also placed in front in a double silhouette is Mickey Mouse, Bryce's most 
requested Disney character. "He wouldn't fit anywhere else," said Bryce, who 
also can cut Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and the rest of the Disney cast 
from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizable film stars, who rarely take a back seat to anyone, present a 
challenge to the silhouette artist. "Celebrities are very hard to do because 
you know their other expressions," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce's wife is another subject who avoids easy depiction: "I know her every 
perfection or imperfection -- however you want to take it -- so I'm never 
completely satisfied. I'll rework it, then overwork it and start over again. 
It's just very frustrating. It's much easier to do a complete stranger." 
</P>
<P>
And about himself: Was he able to capture his own likeness? 
</P>
<P>
"I hated it," he said.

In about 30 seconds, Harry Bryce, the main silhouette artist at Disneyland for 
the past 21 years, can snip the likeness of any man, woman or child out of 
black paper. 
</P>
<P>
The paper portraits of more than 1 million people have been captured by Bryce 
throughout his silhouetting career, and in his Main Street studio at 
Disneyland, the famous profiles of Red Skelton, Goldie Hawn and Cher all have 
been trimmed to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
But for Bryce, the unknown or obscure face is the one that often leaves the 
most indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
"A widow came in asking if I could do a silhouette of her husband," Bryce 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Sure, where's the photograph?' And she said, 'I don't have one, but 
maybe I can describe him to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bryce went to work with paper and scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I made the silhouette as large as I could. I gave him a full head of 
hair and made his lips and nose a little larger than I thought they should be. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I showed it to her and she said, 'Now could you trim this and trim that,' 
and I kept working it down and working it down, until she said, 'You know, 
that's pretty doggone close.' " 
</P>
<P>
But another time, rendering the silhouette of a young man sitting directly in 
front of him didn't prove any less trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you'd call him a dwarf or a midget, but the guy had had some kind of 
accident or some natural impairment on his upper lip; it was literally missing. 
He had nothing but teeth and gums up to the nose area." 
</P>
<P>
Bryce cut out exactly what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"He got off the chair and he shook my hand and said, 'I really thank you. I'm 
so sick and tired of people trying to give me something I don't have. This is 
the first time anybody's ever done me exactly as I look -- and I know what I 
look like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Silhouetting, an old art, has remained popular with the public for several 
reasons. For Jim Griffin of Duarte, Bryce's $3 sitting fee fits handsomely into 
his family budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going to Olan Mills (portrait studio) for a fraction of the cost," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the $3 buys two silhouettes. By folding the 5-by-8-inch paper in 
half, Bryce produces a duplicate silhouette facing the opposite direction. An 
oval frame is an additional $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Barton of Sacramento, whose 8-year-old daughter, Kelli, recently sat for 
Bryce, said she values the silhouette for what she's not getting. "You look at 
it, and you fill in what you can't see. That's the beauty of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Bryce: "Silhouette cutting is to photography what radio is to TV; 
frankly, some things are better left to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland may be the only place in the Southland to have your silhouette cut, 
said Bryce, who estimates that about 25 silhouettists nationwide try to make a 
living at it. But Bonnie Elliott, who began as an apprentice silhouette artist 
at Old Towne Mall in Torrance 17 years ago and now works part time as a 
silhouette cutter at Disneyland, thinks the number may be closer to 250. Both 
artists know of no other operating silhouette studio in the greater Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
That Disneyland has one of the few surviving silhouette studios attests to the 
vision of founder Walt Disney, who frequently referred to "shadow drawing" as 
the origin of all art forms, said Bryce. 
</P>
<P>
"He imagined -- and it's only a guess -- that prehistoric (people) probably 
drew their first pictures by tracing their shadows on the wall," said Bryce. 
That is basically "what we're doing now, except we don't use the shadow, we 
just use the (facial) outline." 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Hickman, in her book "Silhouettes" (Walker and Co.), cites examples of 
black profiles on Etruscan pottery and Egyptian murals as evidence that humans 
have made shadow portraits since the dawn of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The word silhouette to describe a shadow portrait, she writes, is comparatively 
modern, coined in the 19th Century from the name of Etienne de Silhouette 
(1709-67), a frugal French controller-general whose favorite pastime was the 
cutting of profiles from black paper. De Silhouette did not invent the art, 
Hickman writes, but his name was applied to it derisively by those who 
considered profiles in miniature a cheap imitation of art. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of the public, however, silhouettes were inexpensive mementos to be 
exchanged as freely as snapshots are today. 
</P>
<P>
Giving further impetus to shadow portraits was the publication between 1775 and 
1778 of Johann Casper Lavater's "Essay on Physiognomy Calculated to Extend the 
Knowledge and Love of Mankind." In the 34-pound leather-bound tome, Lavater 
argued that plain black profiles were the most penetrating guide to character 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
Although weighty reading, the book was illustrated with several silhouettes 
and, consequently, people rushed to have their profiles drawn in hope of 
deciphering their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hickman, Lavater -- with the assistance of the German poet Goethe, 
himself an amateur profilist -- invented a special silhouette chair designed to 
keep the subject's head rigid. 
</P>
<P>
But not all silhouettes were rapid impressions cut from paper. Just as often, 
silhouettes were painted on ovals of chalk-like plaster, on the reverse sides 
of convex glass and on cards. Portrait silhouettes also decorated fine china 
and expensive jewelry, including rings, brooches, bracelets, lockets, tie-pins, 
card cases and snuff boxes.

Lisa Casco, a 21-year-old college student from Phoenix, Ariz., who recently 
visited Disneyland. "I thought they would trace my outline and fill it in with 
chalk or charcoal -- you know, the way we did it in elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Elliott, who is an art school graduate, Bryce is self-taught and 
maintains he can teach the art of silhouette cutting to anyone in eight to 10 
weeks. In fact, Bryce, who trained the two silhouettists now employed at the 
Disneyland in Tokyo, said he prefers teaching students who can't draw. 
</P>
<P>
"If you find someone who draws, they want to put perspective and give it a 
three-dimensional quality," Bryce said. "They want to add tones and lights and 
darks, but you need none of that in silhouette." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who has cut silhouettes in as little as 17 seconds, compares 
silhouette cutting to riding a bicycle: "You have to develop a certain speed 
and balance; otherwise, you fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott cuts quickly from the bottom up, moving from the base of the neck, to 
the middle of the chin, to underneath the nose, to the eyelashes and finally to 
the top of the head. While bulbous noses, sagging chins and protruding 
foreheads all make the final cut, wrinkles, scars and gray hair vanish with the 
flick of the scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the trick is to keep it all in proportion," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the speed in cutting is to prevent the artist from 
"noodling" -- the temptation to trim or cut more than what the artist sees. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way we're like haircutters," Elliott added. "Once you cut it off, you 
can't put it back." 
</P>
<P>
While Bryce and Elliott may succeed in getting subjects into the studio, 
getting them to take a seat is an art form all in itself. For example, there 
are profile-conscious adults who refuse to be positioned with their "bad side" 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to explain that a silhouette is just one line around the outside of 
their face, identical for either side, but some people refuse to believe it," 
Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Some silhouette subjects feel compelled to brush their hair or apply a fresh 
coat of makeup before posing. "Of course, it doesn't make any difference how 
much rouge or lipstick they put on," Bryce said, "but you can't tell 'em that." 
</P>
<P>
When a man and woman appear in the same silhouette, the man's head usually goes 
in front. "This way I can give more detail to the back of a woman's head, which 
is more interesting than a man's," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Also placed in front in a double silhouette is Mickey Mouse, Bryce's most 
requested Disney character. "He wouldn't fit anywhere else," said Bryce, who 
also can cut Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and the rest of the Disney cast 
from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizable film stars, who rarely take a back seat to anyone, present a 
challenge to the silhouette artist. "Celebrities are very hard to do because 
you know their other expressions," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce's wife is another subject who avoids easy depiction: "I know her every 
perfection or imperfection -- however you want to take it -- so I'm never 
completely satisfied. I'll rework it, then overwork it and start over again. 
It's just very frustrating. It's much easier to do a complete stranger." 
</P>
<P>
And about himself: Was he able to capture his own likeness? 
</P>
<P>
"I hated it," he said.

   The goodwill resulting from a thaw in
relations between Alaska and the Soviet Union is spreading from
people to dogs.
   Susan Butcher, a three-time winner of the 1,100-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race, was to leave Friday for the Soviet Far East
along with a veterinarian and two Iditarod Trail Committee
officials.
   The group has three goals:
   _ Find two Soviet mushers who would live in Manley with Butcher
and her husband, Dave Monson, another winning musher, and learn the
ropes about sled dog racing, Alaska-style.
   _ Examine sled dogs used in the Soviet Union for size and
stamina comparisons with their Alaska counterparts.
   _ Organize a committee on the Soviet side of the Bering Strait
that would help lay out a route for a new, international sled dog
race which would start in Nome and end in the U.S.S.R., after
contestants had been flown across the strait.
   Ginna Brelsford, with the Alaska Office of International Trade
and a member of the Bering Bridge Expedition which traveled 1,000
miles last spring by sled dog and kayak from the Soviet Far East to
Alaska, helped arrange this week-long trip.
   ``All that sounds easy, but it's amazing how much time it takes
to get things done over there,'' Brelsford said of the goals for
Butcher's trip.
   The Soviets are no strangers to using dogs in the Arctic, but
they lag far behind the U.S. in developing racing equipment and
techniques, she said.
   ``When we introduced our sleds, they were excited about how
light and how flexible they were and how easily they could be taken
apart,'' Brelsford said of her trek last spring.
   ``They still operate with heavy leather harnesses and use ivory
hooks to connect things. Their technology is old when it comes to
using dogs and sleds.''
   ``Generally, they use freight animals _ dogs bigger than what
you see running the Iditarod but not necessarily better,''
Brelsford said.
   Monson and Butcher have 120 dogs in their Manley kennel, but
Monson said they always are looking for new bloodlines.
   ``Anything that will improve the general makeup of a sled dog so
it would perform better would be of interest,'' Monson said.
   The new race would be operated separately from the Iditarod,
said Rosemary Phillips, executive director of the race established
in 1973.
   ``We will not be taking anything from the Iditarod Sled Dog Race
to put this on, excepting experience,'' Phillips said. ``We've had
very positive responses from mushers _ lots and lots of calls
wondering how they could enter.''
   The race would be run about the end of March, at least two weeks
after the winner of the Iditarod crosses the finish line in Nome,
she said.
   ``Mushers are a sturdy bunch. You might see much the same teams
in there from the Iditarod.''
   The route would be from Nome to Wales in Alaska. From there,
mushers and dogs would be flown across the Bering Strait for a
restart in Uelen in the U.S.S.R. and the eventual finish at Anadyr,
she said.
   ``We would love to do it in 1990,'' Phillips said.
``Realistically speaking, it probably will be 1991.''
   The group also will be recruiting Soviet mushers and teams for
the Iditarod.
   ``Things like this just serve to break down the barriers,''
Phillips said. ``It's making the world smaller.''

   Fighting warm temperatures and wet
snow, the leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race were out of
Finger Lake and on their way to Rainy Pass early today.
   Thirteen teams left the Finger Lake checkpoint, 193 miles from
the 1,158-mile race's starting line, in one hour late Sunday.
Twenty-three other teams had arrived at the checkpoint.
   Lavon Barve of Wasilla and Jerry Austin of St. Michael pulled
out at 7:39 p.m. They were followed by DeeDee Jonrowe of Bethel,
1987 champion Susan Butcher of Manley, four-time champion Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers and Tim Moerlein of Kasilof.
   Barve and Swenson had declared their 24-hour layovers, then
canceled the layover. All mushers are required to halt for one full
24 hour period during the race to rest themselves and their dogs.
   Temperatures in the Rainy Pass area were in the high 20s early
today, the National Weather Service reported. Temperatures that
hovered around 32 degrees on Saturday took a toll on many of the
sled dogs, which are accustomed to running in much colder weather.
   Herbie Nayokpuk was 18th into Skwentna, a checkpoint 148 miles
from Anchorage, and notified officials he would take the race's
mandatory 24-hour layover in Skwentna.
   ``I've got to save some of my dogs,'' he said. ``I almost burned
them up. I'll have to rest them a little bit.''
   When the lead mushers reach Puntilla Lake in Rainy Pass, they
will have covered 223 miles of the 1,158-mile race.
   Fifty-two teams started the race early Saturday. Defending
champion Butcher finished last year's race in a record 11 days, two
hours.
   The race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to Nome during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of $150,000. The winner will get
$30,000.
   U.S. mushers from outside Alaska, and their positions: Frank
Teasley of Jackson, Wyo., was 15th; Terry Adkins of Mikado, Mich.,
was 21st; Robin Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., was 27th; Dan
MacEachen of Snowmass Village, Colo., was 29th; John Patten of
Grand Marais, Minn., was 35st; and Stan Ferguson of Philadelphia
was 41th.

   Fighting warm temperatures and wet
snow, the leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race were out of
Finger Lake and on their way to Rainy Pass early today.
   Thirteen teams left the Finger Lake checkpoint, 193 miles from
the 1,158-mile race's starting line, in one hour late Sunday.
Twenty-three other teams had arrived at the checkpoint.
   Lavon Barve of Wasilla and Jerry Austin of St. Michael pulled
out at 7:39 p.m. They were followed by DeeDee Jonrowe of Bethel,
1987 champion Susan Butcher of Manley, four-time champion Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers and Tim Moerlein of Kasilof.
   Barve and Swenson had declared their 24-hour layovers, then
canceled the layover. All mushers are required to halt for one full
24 hour period during the race to rest themselves and their dogs.
   Temperatures in the Rainy Pass area were in the high 20s early
today, the National Weather Service reported. Temperatures that
hovered around 32 degrees on Saturday took a toll on many of the
sled dogs, which are accustomed to running in much colder weather.
   Herbie Nayokpuk was 18th into Skwentna, a checkpoint 148 miles
from Anchorage, and notified officials he would take the race's
mandatory 24-hour layover in Skwentna.

<HEAD>Former Football Player Awarded $11.2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has concluded that a defective
football helmet allowed a former high school athlete to suffer a
severe brain injury and has awarded the young man $11.2 million.
   The helmet made by the Bike Athletic Co. was unreasonably
dangerous, leading to acute bleeding within the brain of Richard
Austria, then 16, a Multnomah County Circuit Court jury decided
Monday in an 11-1 vote.
   Austria, now 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical
impairments and requires 24-hour care.
   It apparently was the first time that an injury case involving a
Bike helmet has been presented to a jury. Bike has been in the
helmet business since 1976.
   Mark R. Bocci, an attorney for Austria and his parents, John and
Perla Austria, said several other cases against Bike had been
settled out of court without disclosure of payments.
   Bocci and James M. Pippin, also representing the Austrias,
contended that the Bike Air Power model helmet worn by Austria had
not been adequately tested before the company marketed it.
   Bike and the Kendall Research Center, which tested helmets for
Bike, are both liable for damages. Both are subsidiaries of
Colgate-Palmolive Corp.
   Charles Peery, a Seattle lawyer for Bike, told jurors last week
that helmets similar to the one worn by Austria are used by 80
percent of the players in the Northwest and Alaska, from junior
high school teams to professionals.
   The Air Power model contains a bladder at the crown of the
helmet that is inflated with air. Other padding includes foam
strips, called sizers, that come in various sizes.
   Lawyers for the Austrias contended that the Air Power model for
large heads did not meet national testing standards, although
smaller helmets did pass the tests. They said detailed company
testing records were blank between 1981 and 1984.
   Peery argued that no helmet could eliminate the risk of a
subdural hematoma, bleeding in the brain caused by a blow, and
contended there was no proof that a football injury caused
Austria's hematoma.
   Peery said Austria had ignored advice from his physician not to
play football while he suffered headaches.
   Jurors concluded that Austria was 2 percent at fault, thus
reducing the total award of damages from $11.40 million to $11.19
million. Bocci said Austria would need $5.2 million to provide for
daily care the rest of his life.
   William Mitchell, a Portland lawyer representing Bike, said
there was a strong chance of an appeal.

   A University of Oregon senior faces a
contempt of court charge for enclosing a letter with a parking fine
in which he complained in mostly vulgar terms about having to pay.
   Jeffrey Sebastian, 23, said he was angry about the fine because
he received the parking ticket while taking a required exam. He
suggested, in a letter peppered mostly with profanities, that the
city should coordinate parking with the school when exams are
scheduled.
   ``The emotion did slip,'' Sebastian said about the letter, which
he claims is an expression of constitutionally protected free
speech. ``But that doesn't change the feelings that I felt.''
   After Municipal Judge Frank Bocci read the letter, he ordered
Sebastian to show cause why he shouldn't be held in contempt ``for
disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the judge and
court.''
   Now Sebastian faces the prospect of a $25 fine or 10 days in jail.
   ``I felt it was offensive to the proper judicial operation of the
court and to what's referred to as the dignity of the court,'' Bocci
said this week. He added that it was the first time in 24 years on
the bench that he's issued a contempt citation against someone for
writing a letter.
   The case was heard this week by Pro Tem Judge Jim Spickerman
after Bocci disqualified himself from the case to avoid any bias.
   Floyd Prozanski Jr., a city prosecutor, admitted there were no
Oregon cases dealing with the issue but he cited cases in New Jersey
that appeared to offer some guidance.
   However, defense attorney Steve Chez cited another New Jersey
case that concluded with a pair of rhyming couplets:
   ``Statutory attempts to regulate pure bluster,
   Can't pass what is called constitutional muster.
   Use of vulgar words that may cause resentment,
   Is protected by the First Amendment.''
   A decision is expected next week.

Oregon cases dealing with the issue but he cited cases in New Jersey
that appeared to offer some guidance.

case that concluded with a pair of rhyming couplets:
   ``Statutory attempts to regulate pure bluster,
   Can't pass what is called constitutional muster.
   Use of vulgar words that may cause resentment,
   Is protected by the First Amendment.''

   A University of Oregon senior faces a
contempt of court charge for enclosing a letter with a parking fine
in which he complained in mostly vulgar terms about having to pay.
   Jeffrey Sebastian, 23, said he was angry about the fine because
he received the parking ticket while taking a required exam. He
suggested, in a letter peppered mostly with profanities, that the
city should coordinate parking with the school when exams are
scheduled.
   ``The emotion did slip,'' Sebastian said about the letter, which
he claims is an expression of constitutionally protected free
speech. ``But that doesn't change the feelings that I felt.''
   After Municipal Judge Frank Bocci read the letter, he ordered
Sebastian to show cause why he shouldn't be held in contempt ``for
disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the judge and
court.''
   Now Sebastian faces the prospect of a $25 fine or 10 days in jail.
   ``I felt it was offensive to the proper judicial operation of the
court and to what's referred to as the dignity of the court,'' Bocci
said this week. He added that it was the first time in 24 years on
the bench that he's issued a contempt citation against someone for
writing a letter.
   The case was heard this week by Pro Tem Judge Jim Spickerman
after Bocci disqualified himself from the case to avoid any bias.

FLECKTONES: MORE HIP THAN HAYSEED

<TEXT>
<P>
Bluegrass it ain't. Despite the twang of strings and the whine of a harmonica, 
banjo-picking Bela Fleck and his trio, the Flecktones, come up with something 
more urban than country, more hip than hayseed. 
</P>
<P>
Their music is what the Mahavishnu Orchestra might have sounded like if it had 
been led by Earl Scruggs rather than John McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
The group's long show Monday at the Roxy, consisting mainly of Fleck originals 
pulled from his latest Warner Bros. recording, fused a number of influences and 
technologies with some solid musicianship into what aficionados call "new 
grass." Fleck puts the emphasis on the "new." 
</P>
<P>
Each band member contributed some kind of innovation, even if some were more 
technological than musical. Fleck, who also played acoustic five-string during 
the show, opened on a banjo whose familiar circular soundtable was encased in a 
Fender-style electric guitar body. Even percussionist Roy Wooten, sans traps, 
played a "Drumitar," a drum machine with large pastel buttons that has a neck 
like a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also invention of the musical sort. By bending notes with 
pin-point precision, harmonica-man Howard Levy, who often worked his mouth 
organ with one hand while playing electric keyboard with the other, pulled the 
full chromatic scale from his simple blues harp. Bassist Victor Lemonte Wooten 
(Roy's brother) has adapted the two-handed "tap" technique of guitarist Stanley 
Jordan to his instrument, fingering the neck of his bass as if it were a 
keyboard. During an unaccompanied solo he played the melody of "Chopsticks" and 
"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies" in the upper register while providing his own 
bass line. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck showed some slick chording during his own "Sunset Road," and put in some 
appropriately stormy dissonance during an uptempo "Hurricane Camille."

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  PLAYING a Fender guitar is somewhat like driving a very powerful car,
preferably American-made -- perhaps a 1967 Corvette.;    In the case of the
three-pickup Stratocaster model, you find that this sculpted piece of wood
with two curved teeth by the fingerboard -- an instrument built for Batman --
fits the human body surprisingly well. After you've plugged it into an
amplifier (perhaps a Fender Twin Reverb from the late '60s), you suddenly are
capable of producing the most alarming . . . sound.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LEO FENDER, MUSIC MAKER
THE ENGINEER OF ROCK 'N' ROLL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Such was the legacy of Clarence Leo Fender, the force behind one of the
century's enduring American artifacts -- the solid-body electric guitar. If
rock 'n' roll was invented by Robert Johnson, Elvis Presley and Little
Richard, it was Fender and his company who launched the music's true machine.;
   Purists will argue that Fender, a Fullerton resident who died last month at
82, was not the first to make such a device. Claims are made for the
Rickenbacker company, and for the remarkable Les Paul, who also produced music
from a solid piece of wood in the 1940s (eventually manufactured by Fender's
American arch-rival, the Gibson Corp.). Acoustic guitars had been electrified
for jazz since the 1930s, and perhaps before.;    It was Fender's genius,
though, to mass-produce the solid-wood design that not only made the raucous,
reverberating sounds of rock, but also managed to look the part.;    Like
Levi's and Coca-Cola, the Stratocaster and its more basic cousin, the
Telecaster swept the world in the early '50s. Both have since been copied and
recopied by just about every guitar maker from New York to South Korea. But if
their design can be found everywhere, nothing has quite duplicated the spirit
of the originals.;    Tom Wheeler, in his encyclopedic book "American
Guitars," perfectly catches their visual audacity: "Fender guitars were rock
and roll, jet-age, outrageous. They were as futuristic as Sputnik, or as tacky
as all the sequins in Webb Pierce's wardrobe, depending on your point of view.
Before Fender, there were no turquoise musical instruments, no Candy Apple
Red, scoop-body dragsters with gold-plated hardware and white plastic knobs.";
   Fender's creations became not only the sound of rock 'n' roll, but its
history. Such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Eric Clapton became
inseparable from their Stratocasters (and, in some cases, from their onstage
demolition of them.);    Inevitably, anyone who admired these Strat players
(or Telecaster players such as Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards and Danny
Gatton) would want to own such odd-looking, interesting instruments -- and
would treasure them.;    It is a wonderful aural coincidence that the words
Strad and Strat sound so much alike: A violinist will talk about his
Stradivarius with the same reverence that a rock guitarist will speak about
his Stratocaster.;    The father of the Strat was no great fan of rock.
Rather, Fender was fascinated by the way you could get sounds by placing
magnets under the metal strings of guitars.;    He experimented with coils of
different sizes and impedances -- more intrigued, perhaps, by capacitors than
by harmonies. He held dozens of patents, and so much attention was lavished on
his guitars that one could overlook the fact he made the world's first
electric bass in 1951 -- an instrument that also changed pop music forever.;  
 With astounding understatement, he once said, "I never had too much feeling
for the acoustic guitars. I had always felt that the guitar could do a much
better job if it wasn't limited by the properties of that vibrating top.";   
For him, the combinations of sound, once you were freed from the acoustic
limit, seemed infinite. With a revolutionary three pickups (the Stratocaster
version; Telecasters had only two) and the proper amplifier, musicians could
fill a large room. With enough amplification, they would discover soon enough,
their devices could fill a stadium.;    But even a beginner learns that with a
little experimentation, a mere flick of the wrist, the Fender sound can be
sustained, or vibrated -- and cranked up. It can be turned into Hendrix-like
feedback or Stevie Ray Vaughan-like blues or the B.B. King-like solos on those
Rolling Stones albums.;    This is not a guitar for "Michael, Row the Boat
Ashore." Even on the first test drive, you can imagine it assaulting Jericho's
walls.;    In time, caught in the entropy of our century, things went
downhill. Fender sold the company to CBS in 1965, and since then connoisseurs
of Strats and Teles have looked for the phrase "pre-CBS" whenever one was
sold.;    Guitars that were traded routinely for under $200 in the 1950s and
early 1960s suddenly were going for thousands.;    "Fender Stratocaster, 1957,
Sunburst, Been Through Hell. $5,000" is still a typical advertisement.
Eventually, the unthinkable happened: Fenders were made in Japan. Some still
are, although the company's present owners again are making them in the United
States.;    Fender himself, the man Wheeler calls the "Henry Ford of electric
guitars," continued to build them. He founded G &amp; L Musical Products, and many
G &amp; L instruments are much prized.;    By most accounts, Fender was outwardly
the perfect nerd, absorbed by mechanical things until the end. "He rarely
wears a suit, and he's almost never without his little leather holster full of
screwdrivers," said a long-ago profile in Guitar Player. "In his shirt, he
keeps a plastic pocket protector stuffed with pens, pencils and a metal
ruler.";    He never learned to play the guitar. (box)  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  PLAYING a Fender guitar is somewhat like driving a very powerful car,
preferably American-made -- perhaps a 1967 Corvette.;    In the case of the
three-pickup Stratocaster model, you find that this sculpted piece of wood
with two curved teeth by the fingerboard -- an instrument built for Batman --
fits the human body surprisingly well. After you've plugged it into an
amplifier (perhaps a Fender Twin Reverb from the late '60s), you suddenly are
capable of producing the most alarming . . . sound.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Such was the legacy of Clarence Leo Fender, the force behind one of the
century's enduring American artifacts -- the solid-body electric guitar. If
rock 'n' roll was invented by Robert Johnson, Elvis Presley and Little
Richard, it was Fender and his company who launched the music's true machine.;
   Purists will argue that Fender, a Fullerton resident who died last month at
82, was not the first to make such a device. Claims are made for the
Rickenbacker company, and for the remarkable Les Paul, who also produced music
from a solid piece of wood in the 1940s (eventually manufactured by Fender's
American arch-rival, the Gibson Corp.). Acoustic guitars had been electrified
for jazz since the 1930s, and perhaps before.;    It was Fender's genius,
though, to mass-produce the solid-wood design that not only made the raucous,
reverberating sounds of rock, but also managed to look the part.;    Like
Levi's and Coca-Cola, the Stratocaster and its more basic cousin, the
Telecaster swept the world in the early '50s. Both have since been copied and
recopied by just about every guitar maker from New York to South Korea. But if
their design can be found everywhere, nothing has quite duplicated the spirit
of the originals.;    Tom Wheeler, in his encyclopedic book "American
Guitars," perfectly catches their visual audacity: "Fender guitars were rock
and roll, jet-age, outrageous. They were as futuristic as Sputnik, or as tacky
as all the sequins in Webb Pierce's wardrobe, depending on your point of view.
Before Fender, there were no turquoise musical instruments, no Candy Apple
Red, scoop-body dragsters with gold-plated hardware and white plastic knobs.";
   Fender's creations became not only the sound of rock 'n' roll, but its
history. Such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Eric Clapton became
inseparable from their Stratocasters (and, in some cases, from their onstage
demolition of them.);    Inevitably, anyone who admired these Strat players
(or Telecaster players such as Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards and Danny
Gatton) would want to own such odd-looking, interesting instruments -- and
would treasure them.;    It is a wonderful aural coincidence that the words
Strad and Strat sound so much alike: A violinist will talk about his
Stradivarius with the same reverence that a rock guitarist will speak about
his Stratocaster.;    The father of the Strat was no great fan of rock.
Rather, Fender was fascinated by the way you could get sounds by placing
magnets under the metal strings of guitars.;    He experimented with coils of
different sizes and impedances -- more intrigued, perhaps, by capacitors than
by harmonies. He held dozens of patents, and so much attention was lavished on
his guitars that one could overlook the fact he made the world's first
electric bass in 1951 -- an instrument that also changed pop music forever.;  
 With astounding understatement, he once said, "I never had too much feeling
for the acoustic guitars. I had always felt that the guitar could do a much
better job if it wasn't limited by the properties of that vibrating top.";   
For him, the combinations of sound, once you were freed from the acoustic
limit, seemed infinite. With a revolutionary three pickups (the Stratocaster
version; Telecasters had only two) and the proper amplifier, musicians could
fill a large room. With enough amplification, they would discover soon enough,
their devices could fill a stadium.;    But even a beginner learns that with a
little experimentation, a mere flick of the wrist, the Fender sound can be
sustained, or vibrated -- and cranked up. It can be turned into Hendrix-like
feedback or Stevie Ray Vaughan-like blues or the B.B. King-like solos on those
Rolling Stones albums.;    This is not a guitar for "Michael, Row the Boat
Ashore." Even on the first test drive, you can imagine it assaulting Jericho's
walls.;    In time, caught in the entropy of our century, things went
downhill. Fender sold the company to CBS in 1965, and since then connoisseurs
of Strats and Teles have looked for the phrase "pre-CBS" whenever one was
sold.;    Guitars that were traded routinely for under $200 in the 1950s and
early 1960s suddenly were going for thousands.;    "Fender Stratocaster, 1957,
Sunburst, Been Through Hell. $5,000" is still a typical advertisement.
Eventually, the unthinkable happened: Fenders were made in Japan. Some still
are, although the company's present owners again are making them in the United
States.;    Fender himself, the man Wheeler calls the "Henry Ford of electric
guitars," continued to build them. He founded G &amp; L Musical Products, and many
G &amp; L instruments are much prized.;    By most accounts, Fender was outwardly
the perfect nerd, absorbed by mechanical things until the end. "He rarely
wears a suit, and he's almost never without his little leather holster full of
screwdrivers," said a long-ago profile in Guitar Player. "In his shirt, he
keeps a plastic pocket protector stuffed with pens, pencils and a metal
ruler.";    He never learned to play the guitar. (box)  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A beluga whale died after it was attacked by a dolphin in a pool at the
National Aquarium, officials said Tuesday.;   An autopsy showed that a blow to
the left side of the whale's midsection broke several ribs and ruptured its
heart, said Doug Messinger, curator of marine mammals at the aquarium.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "No one witnessed what happened, but the strongest theory is that a dolphin
delivered the blow to the whale's chest," he said.;   Whales and dolphins were
placed in a pool for three months of interaction at the aquarium's Marine
Mammal Pavilion. Monday, when three beluga whales were chasing two dolphins,
the dolphins suddenly turned and began chasing the whales, Messinger said.;  
The dolphins were removed from the pool, and about a half hour later the

<TEXT>
   Two young whales trapped by ice
tentatively tested a narrow escape route to open water Sunday that
was being carved with chain saws by Eskimos who ordinarily hunt
whales.
   A National Guard helicopter hammered at the ice off Alaska's
northern coast with a 5-ton chunk of concrete. But the whales were
more than three miles from a strech of open water, with a massive
ice ridge in between and a wind shift threatening to push ice
around them and trap them further.
   Rescuers said that even if everything went as planned, it would
be at least Wednesday night before they could get the whales as far
as the ridge.
   As crews concentrated on coaxing the whales to freedom, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asked for help from
two Soviet icebreakers.
   The icebreakers, Admiral Makorov and Vladimir Arseniev, however,
need about 39 feet of water to operate, the Soviet news agency TASS
reported. The whales are trapped in an area where water depth
varies from 12 to 25 feet.
   NOAA Rear Admiral Sigmund R. Petersen, director of the Pacific
Marine Center in Seattle, said even if the icebreakers cannot reach
the whales, they could help clear a path to the first opening, or
lead, from open water 200 miles away.
   Petersen said that depending on ice conditions, the ships could
reach Barrow by noon Tuesday.
   While high-technology equipment poured into Barrow during the
weekend, Eskimos using chain saws and their strong backs made the
most progress at freeing the California gray whales from a tiny
breathing hole.
   About two dozen natives hacked 34 breathing holes Saturday, for
a total of about 60 holes extending more than 1{ miles from where
three whales were stranded by moving ice about two weeks ago before
they could migrate south.
   The smallest and youngest of the whales, named Bone, disappeared
Friday night and was presumed dead.
   Just as the tedious hole-cutting hit its stride, the whales
balked, advancing only a few hundred feet past a large opening
where they spent Friday night and most of Saturday.
   Biologists said the animals had gone back to earlier breathing
holes, sometimes breaking up to 2 inches of ice to surface. They
said that was a good sign because the marine mammals still must
negotiate 200 miles of ice before hitting open water if they are
freed.
   ``If they know they are capable of doing that, they may continue
doing so,'' said biologist Jim Harvey.
   ``Basically, we have to condition them that their best chance of
survival is to move ahead to new holes,'' Harvey said.
   He said rescuers planned to begin filling or covering the holes
behind the whales to force them along the desired path.
   Rescuers said they feared the whales were spooked by an
underwater shoal. North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll said
most of the water in the area is about 20 feet deep, compared to
only 12 or 13 feet of water in the shoal.
   ``You figure two feet of ice and five feet of whale, and that
doesn't leave them too much room to swim,'' Carroll said. ``I don't
blame them for not wanting to go through there.''
   Whaling captain Arnold Brower, whose crew used donated chain
saws to help free the animals, was frustrated by the whales'
reluctance.
   ``If we move them, then I'll call it progress,'' Brower said,
leaning down to push the snout of a surfacing whale in the
direction he wanted it to go.
   Ron Morris, a biologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said sonar would be used to see if
there is an easy way around the shoal.
   The surviving whales appeared to be healthy, immature whales
estimated at 27 to 35 feet long, said David Withrow of the Marine
Mammal Institute in Seattle. He said one apparently was a yearling
and the other was 2 to 3 years old.
   Rescuers worked in the dark using portable lights, snowmobile
headlights and de-icing equipment dubbed ``the bubblers'' to keep
the holes open ahead of the whales.
   The Skycrane helicopter on Saturday used its concrete plunger to
probe the ridge, a jumble of ice blocks as big as a house, but the
battering ram seldom penetrated. The ridge formed by colliding ice
masses is several hundred yards wide.
   Of additional concern was a shift in the wind, which Eskimo
hunters said could turn the area where the whales were trapped into
an impassable jumble of ice rubble.
   NOAA spokesman Brian Gorman in Washington, D.C., said the agency
asked for the Soviet icebreakers and they were dispatched under a
1976 cooperative environmental agreement with the Soviet Union.
   He said the rescue effort also involves use of ``some of our own
NOAA satellites to take ice pictures. We are relaying that
information to the Soviets to assist them in determining the most
expeditious route.''
   Heavy ice in the Arctic Ocean earlier disabled two Canadian
icebreakers and the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Star.
   The latest piece of high technology to be thrown into the battle
is a pontoon-mounted vehicle known as an Archimedes screw, which
pulls itself along by augers that eat into the ice.
   While marine biologists called the whales Bone, Crossbeak and
Bonnet, the Eskimos have named the two survivors Siku, or ice, and
Putu, ice hole. The vanished whale they named Knik, one of 28
Eskimo words for snowflake.
   The young whales' lack of experience apparently led them farther
north than the endangered California gray whales normally go, and
caused them to stay too long before starting their annual migration
to the warm water off Mexico's Baja California, Withrow said.
   Harvey and Withrow said the whales have a reasonable chance of
survival if they can be freed within a week.
   Harvey said the whales condition Sunday appeared stable, but
that a wound on the snout of the larger whale appeared worse than
before.
   The rescue effort had attracted so many spectators and news
teams that a police officer was stationed out on the ice to direct
traffic.
   A giant Air Force C5-A cargo plane sent in with fresh equipment
took up so much ground space at Barrow's airport that a commercial
flight didn't have room to land.

   The young whales' lack of experience apparently led them farther
north than the endangered California gray whales normally go, and
caused them to stay too long before starting their annual migration
to the warm water off Mexico's Baja California, Withrow said.
   Harvey and Withrow said the whales have a reasonable chance of
survival if they can be freed within a week.
   Harvey said the whales condition Sunday appeared stable, but
that a wound on the snout of the larger whale appeared worse than
before.
   The rescue effort had attracted so many spectators and news
teams that a police officer was stationed out on the ice to direct
traffic.
   A giant Air Force C5-A cargo plane sent in with fresh equipment
took up so much ground space at Barrow's airport that a commercial
flight didn't have room to land.

   Two young whales trapped by ice
tentatively tested a narrow escape route to open water Sunday that
was being carved with chain saws by Eskimos who ordinarily hunt
whales.
   A National Guard helicopter hammered at the ice off Alaska's
northern coast with a 5-ton chunk of concrete. But the whales were
more than three miles from a strech of open water, with a massive
ice ridge in between and a wind shift threatening to push ice
around them and trap them further.
   Rescuers said that even if everything went as planned, it would
be at least Wednesday night before they could get the whales as far
as the ridge.
   As crews concentrated on coaxing the whales to freedom, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asked for help from
two Soviet icebreakers.
   The icebreakers, Admiral Makorov and Vladimir Arseniev, however,
need about 39 feet of water to operate, the Soviet news agency TASS
reported. The whales are trapped in an area where water depth
varies from 12 to 25 feet.
   NOAA Rear Admiral Sigmund R. Petersen, director of the Pacific
Marine Center in Seattle, said even if the icebreakers cannot reach
the whales, they could help clear a path to the first opening, or
lead, from open water 200 miles away.
   Petersen said that depending on ice conditions, the ships could
reach Barrow by noon Tuesday.
   While high-technology equipment poured into Barrow during the
weekend, Eskimos using chain saws and their strong backs made the
most progress at freeing the California gray whales from a tiny
breathing hole.
   About two dozen natives hacked 34 breathing holes Saturday, for
a total of about 60 holes extending more than 1{ miles from where
three whales were stranded by moving ice about two weeks ago before
they could migrate south.
   The smallest and youngest of the whales, named Bone, disappeared
Friday night and was presumed dead.
   Just as the tedious hole-cutting hit its stride, the whales
balked, advancing only a few hundred feet past a large opening
where they spent Friday night and most of Saturday.
   Biologists said the animals had gone back to earlier breathing
holes, sometimes breaking up to 2 inches of ice to surface. They
said that was a good sign because the marine mammals still must
negotiate 200 miles of ice before hitting open water if they are
freed.
   ``If they know they are capable of doing that, they may continue
doing so,'' said biologist Jim Harvey.
   ``Basically, we have to condition them that their best chance of
survival is to move ahead to new holes,'' Harvey said.
   He said rescuers planned to begin filling or covering the holes
behind the whales to force them along the desired path.
   Rescuers said they feared the whales were spooked by an
underwater shoal. North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll said
most of the water in the area is about 20 feet deep, compared to
only 12 or 13 feet of water in the shoal.
   ``You figure two feet of ice and five feet of whale, and that
doesn't leave them too much room to swim,'' Carroll said. ``I don't
blame them for not wanting to go through there.''
   Whaling captain Arnold Brower, whose crew used donated chain
saws to help free the animals, was frustrated by the whales'
reluctance.
   ``If we move them, then I'll call it progress,'' Brower said,
leaning down to push the snout of a surfacing whale in the
direction he wanted it to go.
   Ron Morris, a biologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said sonar would be used to see if
there is an easy way around the shoal.
   The surviving whales appeared to be healthy, immature whales
estimated at 27 to 35 feet long, said David Withrow of the Marine
Mammal Institute in Seattle. He said one apparently was a yearling
and the other was 2 to 3 years old.
   Rescuers worked in the dark using portable lights, snowmobile
headlights and de-icing equipment dubbed ``the bubblers'' to keep
the holes open ahead of the whales.
   The Skycrane helicopter on Saturday used its concrete plunger to
probe the ridge, a jumble of ice blocks as big as a house, but the
battering ram seldom penetrated. The ridge formed by colliding ice
masses is several hundred yards wide.
   Of additional concern was a shift in the wind, which Eskimo
hunters said could turn the area where the whales were trapped into
an impassable jumble of ice rubble.
   NOAA spokesman Brian Gorman in Washington, D.C., said the agency
asked for the Soviet icebreakers and they were dispatched under a
1976 cooperative environmental agreement with the Soviet Union.
   He said the rescue effort also involves use of ``some of our own
NOAA satellites to take ice pictures. We are relaying that
information to the Soviets to assist them in determining the most
expeditious route.''
   Heavy ice in the Arctic Ocean earlier disabled two Canadian
icebreakers and the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Star.
   The latest piece of high technology to be thrown into the battle
is a pontoon-mounted vehicle known as an Archimedes screw, which
pulls itself along by augers that eat into the ice.
   While marine biologists called the whales Bone, Crossbeak and
Bonnet, the Eskimos have named the two survivors Siku, or ice, and
Putu, ice hole. The vanished whale they named Knik, one of 28
Eskimo words for snowflake.
   The young whales' lack of experience apparently led them farther
north than the endangered California gray whales normally go, and
caused them to stay too long before starting their annual migration

MELVIN DURSLAG: U.S. GETS NO KICK FROM SOCCER

<TEXT>
<P>
Performing in soccer the other night amid the historic splendor of the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, whose preservation exceeds in importance that of any of the 
great pyramids, the Soviet Union and Colombia drew only 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, one was dealing here with box office nations, appearing in the news 
almost as much as the Trumps. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as before, one inspecting attendance was led to ask oneself that 
question of vital sociological concern -- why won't U.S. spectators go for 
soccer? 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is an excellent game, appreciated by viewers the planet over. If 
something exists that may be called the true international sport, it would be 
soccer. Its World Cup enjoys status of an athletic classic. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the effort of soccer to establish a beachhead in the United 
States, whatever arguments made in the game's behalf, soccer has lost its 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
And, professionally today, the sport here is reduced to an endeavor labeled 
indoor soccer, performed under a roof on a short field flanked by plexiglass 
boards, off which the ball can be played on the carom, as in jai alai. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas standard soccer features 11 to a side, indoor calls for six. And if you 
wonder idly what an indoor participant looks like, be assured he comes with one 
head, two arms, two legs and the usual number of fingers and toes. 
</P>
<P>
The indoor league, once comprising 12 teams, is down to eight, struggling to 
keep its pulse in the tradition of any form of pro soccer in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced in 1967 that outdoor soccer stood on the doorsill of greatness in 
North America, promoters put together two leagues, consisting of 22 teams. Such 
confidence was vested in the sport that the rival leagues, amazingly, 
overlapped in five cities. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, for instance, was the home of the Toros and the Zorros, the latter 
owned by Jack Kent Cooke, who exclaimed rapturously: "What a marvelous game! Do 
you realize you can outfit a whole soccer team for what it costs to dress one 
football player?" 
</P>
<P>
Making sure he had a place large enough to accommodate the throngs, Jack booked 
his games in the Rose Bowl, capacity 106,000. Opening night, he looked 
wistfully at a Zorro audience of 1,251. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros selected as home the L.A. Coliseum, capacity 93,000. Asked by a 
sportswriter for two tickets to the opener, the publicist responded, "How about 
a section?" 
</P>
<P>
If one got into a soccer deal, who needed Lincoln Savings? 
</P>
<P>
Feeling it had found the Lost Dutchman mine, CBS came aboard, blowing an 
immense amount of money in putting the games on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Those who like soccer still aren't able to believe they have on their hands in 
this country a spectator disaster. The game, they argue, has a massive base, 
stemming from 8,000,000 amateurs who are playing the sport at levels ranging 
from 4-year-olds to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Fans, soccer boosters insist, identify with the pro players, who are average in 
appearance. They don't weigh 275. They don't rise 7 feet. They have the teeth 
they came with. 
</P>
<P>
When the late Abe Saperstein formed the American Basketball League, he promised 
to put players on the floor of normal height. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is sick of looking at freaks," announced Abe, who, crashing with 
his league, misread public taste. 
</P>
<P>
Are soccer players too normal for the game's good? 
</P>
<P>
Those trying to explain why the sport can't build a flame in American hearts 
usually begin by noting that soccer bucks baseball, and is judged by football. 
</P>
<P>
Will fans accustomed to watching the 49ers move the ball sit still for a Soviet 
Union-Colombia match the other night, ending 1-0 with a penalty kick in 
overtime? 
</P>
<P>
In soccer, 1-0 can be a slugfest. The Netherlands and Italy, two of the world's 
top teams, played to a scoreless draw earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Then it has been asked whether Americans reject soccer because teams here have 
featured too many foreigners? Well, baseball brims with Dominicans, Puerto 
Ricans, Cubans and Panamanians, and the only ones rejected are those who hit 
.210. 
</P>
<P>
But, for all its reversals in the United States, soccer remains hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the Wichita Wings assured us one day: "It's just a 
matter of getting our foot in the American door. We have a fast, lively 
product. Our players are appealing. They don't wear pads, helmets, or face 
masks. And the ball is easier to follow than a puck." 
</P>
<P>
It even may be easier to follow than a horse on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer makes a compelling argument. All it has to do is sell it to those who 
don't buy its tickets.

The indoor league, once comprising 12 teams, is down to eight, struggling to 
keep its pulse in the tradition of any form of pro soccer in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced in 1967 that outdoor soccer stood on the doorsill of greatness in 
North America, promoters put together two leagues, consisting of 22 teams. Such 
confidence was vested in the sport that the rival leagues, amazingly, 
overlapped in five cities. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, for instance, was the home of the Toros and the Zorros, the latter 
owned by Jack Kent Cooke, who exclaimed rapturously: "What a marvelous game! Do 
you realize you can outfit a whole soccer team for what it costs to dress one 
football player?" 
</P>
<P>
Making sure he had a place large enough to accommodate the throngs, Jack booked 
his games in the Rose Bowl, capacity 106,000. Opening night, he looked 
wistfully at a Zorro audience of 1,251. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros selected as home the L.A. Coliseum, capacity 93,000. Asked by a 
sportswriter for two tickets to the opener, the publicist responded, "How about 
a section?" 
</P>
<P>
If one got into a soccer deal, who needed Lincoln Savings? 
</P>
<P>
Feeling it had found the Lost Dutchman mine, CBS came aboard, blowing an 
immense amount of money in putting the games on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Those who like soccer still aren't able to believe they have on their hands in 
this country a spectator disaster. The game, they argue, has a massive base, 
stemming from 8,000,000 amateurs who are playing the sport at levels ranging 
from 4-year-olds to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Fans, soccer boosters insist, identify with the pro players, who are average in 
appearance. They don't weigh 275. They don't rise 7 feet. They have the teeth 
they came with. 
</P>
<P>
When the late Abe Saperstein formed the American Basketball League, he promised 
to put players on the floor of normal height. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is sick of looking at freaks," announced Abe, who, crashing with 
his league, misread public taste. 
</P>
<P>
Are soccer players too normal for the game's good? 
</P>
<P>
Those trying to explain why the sport can't build a flame in American hearts 
usually begin by noting that soccer bucks baseball, and is judged by football. 
</P>
<P>
Will fans accustomed to watching the 49ers move the ball sit still for a Soviet 
Union-Colombia match the other night, ending 1-0 with a penalty kick in 
overtime? 
</P>
<P>
In soccer, 1-0 can be a slugfest. The Netherlands and Italy, two of the world's 
top teams, played to a scoreless draw earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Then it has been asked whether Americans reject soccer because teams here have 
featured too many foreigners? Well, baseball brims with Dominicans, Puerto 
Ricans, Cubans and Panamanians, and the only ones rejected are those who hit 
.210. 
</P>
<P>
But, for all its reversals in the United States, soccer remains hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the Wichita Wings assured us one day: "It's just a 
matter of getting our foot in the American door. We have a fast, lively 
product. Our players are appealing. They don't wear pads, helmets, or face 
masks. And the ball is easier to follow than a puck." 
</P>
<P>
It even may be easier to follow than a horse on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer makes a compelling argument. All it has to do is sell it to those who 
don't buy its tickets.

MELVIN DURSLAG: U.S. GETS NO KICK FROM SOCCER

<P>
Performing in soccer the other night amid the historic splendor of the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, whose preservation exceeds in importance that of any of the 
great pyramids, the Soviet Union and Colombia drew only 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, one was dealing here with box office nations, appearing in the news 
almost as much as the Trumps. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as before, one inspecting attendance was led to ask oneself that 
question of vital sociological concern -- why won't U.S. spectators go for 
soccer? 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is an excellent game, appreciated by viewers the planet over. If 
something exists that may be called the true international sport, it would be 
soccer. Its World Cup enjoys status of an athletic classic. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the effort of soccer to establish a beachhead in the United 
States, whatever arguments made in the game's behalf, soccer has lost its 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
And, professionally today, the sport here is reduced to an endeavor labeled 
indoor soccer, performed under a roof on a short field flanked by plexiglass 
boards, off which the ball can be played on the carom, as in jai alai. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas standard soccer features 11 to a side, indoor calls for six. And if you 
wonder idly what an indoor participant looks like, be assured he comes with one 
head, two arms, two legs and the usual number of fingers and toes.

SAFEST BET OF SERIES WAS FOOTBALL SALES;

Fotoball USA owners were rooting for the Oakland Athletics to win the 1990 
World Series, but it really did not matter to them that the Cincinnati Reds 
emerged victorious. Whichever team won, the San Diego company expected to come 
out smelling like a rose long after the last crack of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old company is licensed by Major League Baseball to manufacture 
special edition Fotoballs and roster balls for the World Series. The Fotoballs 
are actual baseballs imprinted with color pictures of either players from the 
A's or the Reds, and bear the 1990 World Series logo nd team seal. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the Oct. 16 start of the World Series, employees at Fotoball 
USA began working overtime at the company's Rose Canyon plant, cranking out 
more than 3,000 series balls a day. The company does not expect to slow down 
until sometime this week, said Michael Favish, Fotoball's 42-year-old 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The roster balls are imprinted with the team seal and a player roster. To 
commemorate their four-game sweep of the series, the Cincinnati Reds' balls are 
stamped World Champions as well as 1990 National League Champions. The Oakland 
balls bear the 1990 American League Champions stamp. Working 12-hour shifts, 
the company has been filling orders as fast as it can, said Derrick Favish, 
Michael's 38-year-old brother and business partner. 
</P>
<P>
The balls were sold for about $13 at the Oakland Coliseum, Cincinnati's 
Riverfront Stadium, via The Home Shopping Network on cable television and in 
gift shops around the country, Favish said. On Monday, orders were still coming 
in, and at last count, the company had sold 20,000 balls. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the series out of the corner of his eye on an office television last 
week, Favish said sales of World Series balls will represent about 10% of the 
company's estimated $2.3 million in sales this year. The company, which opened 
its doors in March, 1989, grossed about $860,000 in 1989 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of the year, the company's 23 employees are busy pumping out 
player balls and roster balls of league teams and limited-edition autograph 
balls, Favish said. The company has also diversified into Fotopucks, hockey 
pucks with players' pictures, team crests and career highlights; football 
Fotoballs; and Fotosweats, or sweatbands imprinted with baseball players' 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The autographed baseball series includes balls signed by Tony Gwynn of the 
Padres; Johnny Bench, Cincinnati Reds' Hall of Fame player; and Jerome Walton, 
a Chicago Cubs' outfielder. "We did a limited, hand-signed edition of the Wayne 
Gretzky Fotopuck which sold out in six weeks for $199 a piece," Favish said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fotoball concept got its start in 1985 with a soccer ball, he said. "I 
built the first prototype on my living room floor." 
</P>
<P>
Favish, a native of South Africa, had sold his interest in a Beverly Hills art 
gallery the year before. "I was kind of at loose ends for a couple of months, 
and this thing came up and I had some time to spend on it. That was very 
fortunate because it took a lot of time and effort." 
</P>
<P>
"I played soccer as a child, and I was very involved with my kids' youth 
programs in Los Angeles. The idea for imprinting balls came from a toy soccer 
ball that had animal characters on it. One of my brothers said, why couldn't 
somebody put players on it instead. A penny dropped, and I started fiddling 
around with paints and tapes and all the things that make a prototype." 
</P>
<P>
But selling the soccer-ball concept proved too difficult because the main 
market at the time was in Europe, Favish said. So, Favish turned his energies 
to finding a color process to print photos on baseballs. "That in itself was a 
full-time task," Favish said, adding that printing on a soccer ball was child's 
play compared to a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It was a much easier task to print on the 32-panel soccer balls before they 
were assembled, he said. "Baseballs couldn't be done that way. You had to print 
on the baseball once it was already fabricated in the round. So, to come up 
with a process, took my brother and me half of 1987 and all of 1988. I'm a real 
fusspot when it comes to quality." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers went to Italy to work with engineers there to fabricate the 
printing machines to their specifications. They had to draw from several 
different types of machines because what they needed did not exist, Favish 
said. "The machines are one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
The company has an international flavor, Favish said. "We've got an American 
sports product being made by two South African guys using Laotian labor, 
Italian machines and balls made in China. We're all equal rights here." 
</P>
<P>
The company now has three major league baseball licenses, three National 
Football League licenses, and two National Hockey League licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Professional sports licensing is a major industry, Favish said. Last year, 325 
companies that bought rights from major league baseball grossed more than $1 
billion from retail sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But getting a license is no small feat, Favish said. The products are closely 
scrutinized by the league for quality and design, and the company has to pay an 
advance royalty based on expected sales, usually never less than $25,000, he 
said. Then the company pays the league 8 1/2% in royalties once sales begin. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always wondering where my Ferrari is. It's not ready to be driven 
up to the front door yet," Favish said. "The bigger you get, the more money you 
need. (It) costs plenty to do what we do. You have to have balls to print on, 
you have to have packaging to put the finished product into. We need additional 
staff, shipping crates and cartons. The number of employees has grown from 
three to 23." 
</P>
<P>
"Going from a two-product line to a nine-product line is like starting a new 
business," Favish said. "You don't just put nine products in your product 
catalogue and rake in the money. It's not that way." 
</P>
<P>
Getting the products to market is the company's biggest challenge, Favish said. 
Using a network of representatives and distributors, the baseball Fotoballs are 
sold in outlets ranging from Wal Mart stores and airport gift shops to baseball 
card stores and sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
Favish said his company is targeting sales of $4 million next year. "Whether we 
achieve it or not will be a function of our ability to bring the products to 
market," he said.

Favish, a native of South Africa, had sold his interest in a Beverly Hills art 
gallery the year before. "I was kind of at loose ends for a couple of months, 
and this thing came up and I had some time to spend on it. That was very 
fortunate because it took a lot of time and effort." 
</P>
<P>
"I played soccer as a child, and I was very involved with my kids' youth 
programs in Los Angeles. The idea for imprinting balls came from a toy soccer 
ball that had animal characters on it. One of my brothers said, why couldn't 
somebody put players on it instead. A penny dropped, and I started fiddling 
around with paints and tapes and all the things that make a prototype." 
</P>
<P>
But selling the soccer-ball concept proved too difficult because the main 
market at the time was in Europe, Favish said. So, Favish turned his energies 
to finding a color process to print photos on baseballs. "That in itself was a 
full-time task," Favish said, adding that printing on a soccer ball was child's 
play compared to a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It was a much easier task to print on the 32-panel soccer balls before they 
were assembled, he said. "Baseballs couldn't be done that way. You had to print 
on the baseball once it was already fabricated in the round. So, to come up 
with a process, took my brother and me half of 1987 and all of 1988. I'm a real 
fusspot when it comes to quality." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers went to Italy to work with engineers there to fabricate the 
printing machines to their specifications. They had to draw from several 
different types of machines because what they needed did not exist, Favish 
said. "The machines are one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
The company has an international flavor, Favish said. "We've got an American 
sports product being made by two South African guys using Laotian labor, 
Italian machines and balls made in China. We're all equal rights here." 
</P>
<P>
The company now has three major league baseball licenses, three National 
Football League licenses, and two National Hockey League licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Professional sports licensing is a major industry, Favish said. Last year, 325 
companies that bought rights from major league baseball grossed more than $1 
billion from retail sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But getting a license is no small feat, Favish said. The products are closely 
scrutinized by the league for quality and design, and the company has to pay an 
advance royalty based on expected sales, usually never less than $25,000, he 
said. Then the company pays the league 8 1/2% in royalties once sales begin. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always wondering where my Ferrari is. It's not ready to be driven 
up to the front door yet," Favish said. "The bigger you get, the more money you 
need. (It) costs plenty to do what we do. You have to have balls to print on, 
you have to have packaging to put the finished product into. We need additional 
staff, shipping crates and cartons. The number of employees has grown from 
three to 23." 
</P>
<P>
"Going from a two-product line to a nine-product line is like starting a new 
business," Favish said. "You don't just put nine products in your product 
catalogue and rake in the money. It's not that way." 
</P>
<P>
Getting the products to market is the company's biggest challenge, Favish said. 
Using a network of representatives and distributors, the baseball Fotoballs are 
sold in outlets ranging from Wal Mart stores and airport gift shops to baseball 
card stores and sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
Favish said his company is targeting sales of $4 million next year. "Whether we 
achieve it or not will be a function of our ability to bring the products to 
market," he said.

Fotoball USA owners were rooting for the Oakland Athletics to win the 1990 
World Series, but it really did not matter to them that the Cincinnati Reds 
emerged victorious. Whichever team won, the San Diego company expected to come 
out smelling like a rose long after the last crack of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old company is licensed by Major League Baseball to manufacture 
special edition Fotoballs and roster balls for the World Series. The Fotoballs 
are actual baseballs imprinted with color pictures of either players from the 
A's or the Reds, and bear the 1990 World Series logo nd team seal. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the Oct. 16 start of the World Series, employees at Fotoball 
USA began working overtime at the company's Rose Canyon plant, cranking out 
more than 3,000 series balls a day. The company does not expect to slow down 
until sometime this week, said Michael Favish, Fotoball's 42-year-old 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The roster balls are imprinted with the team seal and a player roster. To 
commemorate their four-game sweep of the series, the Cincinnati Reds' balls are 
stamped World Champions as well as 1990 National League Champions. The Oakland 
balls bear the 1990 American League Champions stamp. Working 12-hour shifts, 
the company has been filling orders as fast as it can, said Derrick Favish, 
Michael's 38-year-old brother and business partner. 
</P>
<P>
The balls were sold for about $13 at the Oakland Coliseum, Cincinnati's 
Riverfront Stadium, via The Home Shopping Network on cable television and in 
gift shops around the country, Favish said. On Monday, orders were still coming 
in, and at last count, the company had sold 20,000 balls. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the series out of the corner of his eye on an office television last 
week, Favish said sales of World Series balls will represent about 10% of the 
company's estimated $2.3 million in sales this year. The company, which opened 
its doors in March, 1989, grossed about $860,000 in 1989 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of the year, the company's 23 employees are busy pumping out 
player balls and roster balls of league teams and limited-edition autograph 
balls, Favish said. The company has also diversified into Fotopucks, hockey 
pucks with players' pictures, team crests and career highlights; football 
Fotoballs; and Fotosweats, or sweatbands imprinted with baseball players' 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The autographed baseball series includes balls signed by Tony Gwynn of the 
Padres; Johnny Bench, Cincinnati Reds' Hall of Fame player; and Jerome Walton, 
a Chicago Cubs' outfielder. "We did a limited, hand-signed edition of the Wayne 
Gretzky Fotopuck which sold out in six weeks for $199 a piece," Favish said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fotoball concept got its start in 1985 with a soccer ball, he said. "I 
built the first prototype on my living room floor." 
</P>
<P>
Favish, a native of South Africa, had sold his interest in a Beverly Hills art 
gallery the year before. "I was kind of at loose ends for a couple of months, 
and this thing came up and I had some time to spend on it. That was very 
fortunate because it took a lot of time and effort."

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and China's
president, Yang Shangkun, today discussed China's troubled region of
Tibet, and Gandhi said his country will not interfere in China's
internal affairs.
   The Indian leader spent much of his second day in China
sightseeing.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Yang explained China's
position on Tibet to Gandhi during a one-hour meeting at the Great
Hall of the People.
   Yang, 81, who has held the largely ceremonial post of president
since April, stressed that the Beijing government provides
assistance to the Tibetan region, one of China's most backward areas.
   ``We respect the religious beliefs and customs and habits of the
Tibetan people, and they enjoy the freedom of religious belief,''
Yang said.
   Gandhi repeated India's position that Tibet is an autonomous
region of China and that India will not interfere in China's
internal affairs, Xinhua said.
   The Tibetan issue has long been a source of tension between the
two countries because India has provided refuge to the Tibetan
religious leader, the Dalai Lama, and his followers, who have
demanded independence for Tibet. The Dalai Lama fled to India in
1959 after he led a failed uprising against Chinese military forces.
   At least one Tibetan monk was shot and killed by Chinese security
forces during a demonstration in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on
Dec. 10. It was the third outbreak of anti-Chinese violence in Lhasa
in the past 14 months.
   China and India are trying to restore friendly ties after a
quarter century of soured relations, which hit bottom during a
21-day border war in 1962.
   The border question was the main topic during talks Monday
between Gandhi and China's Premier Li Peng.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of what India says is part of
its northeast state of Arunachal Pradesh. India claims 14,500 square
miles of land seized by China in 1962.
   Gandhi and Li, however, vowed not to let the border problem
interfere with efforts to improve the strained bilateral ties.
   Gandhi is the first Indian leader to visit China since his
grandfather, former Prime Minister Jawalharlal Nehru, came in 1954.
   Accomapnied by his Italian-born wife, Sonia, Gandhi today
traveled about 37 miles northwest of Beijing to the Badaling section
of the Great Wall, the 3,720-mile-long barrier built over a
2,000-year period to keep out invaders.
   The Indian leader also visited the Temple of Heaven, a 15th
century structure where China's emperors once prayed for good
harvests and performed sacrificial rituals.
   On Wednesday, Gandhi is scheduled to meet 84-year-old senior
leader Deng Xiaoping and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang.
   The two sides are expected to sign agreements on civil aviation,
border trade, science and technology and the exchange of consular
offices in Shanghai and Bombay.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today accused the United States and Pakistan of creating obstacles
in implementing the accord that provides for the withdrawal of Red
Army troops from Afghanistan.
   ``Pakistan and the United States find it hard to accept new
approaches to international affairs,'' Gorbachev said at a ceremony
where he received a peace prize named for former Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi.
   ``Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to
rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that
are obvious,'' Gorbachev said on the second day of his three-day
state visit to India.
   The Soviet Union agreed in April to withdraw its estimated
100,000 troops from Afghanistan, and about half the troops have
left. Soviet troops entered in December 1979 and have been helping
the Marxist government battle U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of continuing to
serve as a conduit for arms to the rebels in violation of the accord.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev said a challenge by the Soviet republic
of Estonia to Kremlin authority was part of the ongoing process of
``perestroika,'' or social change promoted by the Soviet leader.
Estonia's parliament this week declared Estonia was sovereign and
has the right to veto Soviet laws.
   In his first public reaction to a rise of nationalism in the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Gorbachev said:
``There is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem. I am sure
things will settle down.''
   The Soviet leader also said good relations between the Soviet
Union, China and India were necessary for peace in the Asia-Pacific
region.
   ``We are pleased to see signs of improvement in Indo-Chinese
relations,'' he said. ``Our own relations with China are also
evolving in an encouraging way.''
   ``Thinking of countries like the Soviet Union, India and China,
one is inevitably led to realize that good relations between them
are extremely important for the destinies of Asia and for global
progress.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is scheduled to visit Beijing
next month, the first Indian head of government to visit the country
in 34 years. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is scheduled to visit
Moscow early next year.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have had long-standing border
problems with China. India and China fought a brief war in 1962 over
the issue.
   Gorbachev's comments on the unrest in the Baltic states were made
informally to reporters at a memorial to Mrs. Gandhi, which he
visited before the award ceremony.
   Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, placed a wreath of red
roses at Mrs. Gandhi's memorial. He placed similar floral tributes
at memorials to her father and India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru, and to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the hero of India's
freedom movement.
   An estimated 7,000 Afghan refugees, many of them opposed to
Soviet military involvement in their homeland, were confined to
their homes in New Delhi under police order for a second day. One
police officer said the order was issued to prevent any
embarrassment to the Soviet leader.
   The order asked Afghans not to ``move out of your residence till
21.11.88. ... Non-compliance of the order will render you liable for
prosecution.''
   The Afghans were also asked to report to nearest police stations
every morning for a head count, the officer said on condition of
anonymity.
   Gorbachev has sought to dispel any doubts about the future of
Soviet-Indian relations. In an apparent reference to China,
Gorbachev said ``the development of relations with third countries''
would not affect the Kremlin's friendly ties with India.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have showed signs of easing
long-standing strains in relations with China, prompting concerns
expressed by some Indian newspapers and some Indian officials about
shifts in the political balances in Asia.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today accused the United States and Pakistan of creating obstacles
in implementing the accord that provides for the withdrawal of Red
Army troops from Afghanistan.
   ``Pakistan and the United States find it hard to accept new
approaches to international affairs,'' Gorbachev said at a ceremony
where he received a peace prize named for former Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi.
   ``Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to
rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that
are obvious,'' Gorbachev said on the second day of his three-day
state visit to India.
   The Soviet Union agreed in April to withdraw its estimated
100,000 troops from Afghanistan, and about half the troops have
left. Soviet troops entered in December 1979 and have been helping
the Marxist government battle U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of continuing to
serve as a conduit for arms to the rebels in violation of the accord.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev said a challenge by the Soviet republic
of Estonia to Kremlin authority was part of the ongoing process of
``perestroika,'' or social change promoted by the Soviet leader.
Estonia's parliament this week declared Estonia was sovereign and
has the right to veto Soviet laws.
   In his first public reaction to a rise of nationalism in the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Gorbachev said:
``There is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem. I am sure
things will settle down.''
   The Soviet leader also said good relations between the Soviet
Union, China and India were necessary for peace in the Asia-Pacific
region.
   ``We are pleased to see signs of improvement in Indo-Chinese
relations,'' he said. ``Our own relations with China are also
evolving in an encouraging way.''
   ``Thinking of countries like the Soviet Union, India and China,
one is inevitably led to realize that good relations between them
are extremely important for the destinies of Asia and for global
progress.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is scheduled to visit Beijing
next month, the first Indian head of government to visit the country
in 34 years. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is scheduled to visit
Moscow early next year.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have had long-standing border
problems with China. India and China fought a brief war in 1962 over
the issue.
   Gorbachev's comments on the unrest in the Baltic states were made
informally to reporters at a memorial to Mrs. Gandhi, which he
visited before the award ceremony.
   Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, placed a wreath of red
roses at Mrs. Gandhi's memorial. He placed similar floral tributes
at memorials to her father and India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru, and to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the hero of India's
freedom movement.
   An estimated 7,000 Afghan refugees, many of them opposed to
Soviet military involvement in their homeland, were confined to
their homes in New Delhi under police order for a second day. One
police officer said the order was issued to prevent any
embarrassment to the Soviet leader.
   The order asked Afghans not to ``move out of your residence till
21.11.88. ... Non-compliance of the order will render you liable for
prosecution.''
   The Afghans were also asked to report to nearest police stations
every morning for a head count, the officer said on condition of
anonymity.

  [Text] The prime minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's 
official visit to the Philippines, the first by a Malaysian 
premier to that country, is already yielding results. The 
Philippine Government is keen and serious about enhancing trade 
relations with Malaysia. And this should be the case with 
[words indistinct] ASEAN. In response to Dr. Mahathir and his 
delegation's visit to the Philippines in February, a 
high-powered multimember delegation from the Philippines paid a 
two-day visit last weekend to the Federal Territory of Labuan 
off the East Malaysian state of Sabah. The Philippine delegation 
was truly interested in knowing more about the development of 
Labuan as an offshore financial center and also about foreign 
investment opportunities in both the East Malaysian states of 
Sabah and Sarawak. What is encouraging is that the visit showed 
the commitment of the Philippine Government to the development 
of the East ASEAN Growth Area. The visiting mission was given a 
detailed briefing on the investment opportunities available in 
Labuan as well as in Sabah and Sarawak. 
  It is noteworthy that the Philippine delegation's visit was 
the first by a well-represented government and private sector 
mission from that country. What seemed to interest them was the 
function of Labuan as an international offshore financial 
center, or IOFC. The delegation included a group of bankers who 
appreciated the IOFC concept being adopted in Labuan. The 
president of the Philippine National Bank has been quoted as 
saying his bank was considering setting up an offshore bank in 
Labuan. The bank would like to finalize joint financial 
undertakings not only with the Malaysian Government but also 
with the private sector. 
  Cooperation between the Philippines and Malaysia is 
certainly 
on the way up. One of Malaysia's leading companies is currently 
involved in the development of infrastructure in the 
Philippines. Malaysian participation in the power supply, stock 
development, and telecommunication sector will also be welcomed 
in the Philippines. [Words indistinct], both countries can help 
each other to promote their respective tourism industry. The 
idea of setting up a regional air link needs serious 
consideration. The visit by the Philippine president, Fidel 
Ramos, to Malaysia last year and the reciprocal visit by Dr. 
Mahathir have opened the way for increased cooperation between 
the two ASEAN partners. The private sector of the two countries 
should take this opportunity to go into joint ventures for their 
mutual benefit. <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>

  [Text] The honor guard at Hanoi's international airport has 
probably never been so busy. Since Washington lifted its 
three-decade-old economic embargo on Vietnam in February, the 
formerly shunned communist bastion has been besieged by 
diplomatic visitors. 
  Leading the rush, have been the heads of the Association of 
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), all eager to look at 
investment prospects and assess Hanoi's ambitions to join their 
privileged group. Within the space of a little over a month, 
Vietnam has hosted visits from the secretary general of ASEAN 
and the leaders of Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. 
  Communist Party chief Du Muoi was a guest of Malaysia last 
week, and President Le Duc Anh is due to visit Indonesia in late 
April. The visits coincide with a diplomatic offensive on the 
part of Vietnam, which is trying to widen ties with ASEAN and 
pave the way for its own entry into the group. 
  The official exchanges mark the second major diplomatic 
offensive Vietnam has launched following the break up of the 
Soviet bloc. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN 
members between October 1991 and July 1992 as Vietnam searched 
for new economic partners. At the time, most observers 
predicted that it would be at least five years before Vietnam 
would be admitted. But in a reflection of the sweeping 
political changes that are occurring across the region, 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced in Hanoi that 
he thought Vietnam may be formally discussed in 18 months. 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos was even more optimistic, 
calling for the immediate acceptance of Vietnam. 
  Political differences between communist Vietnam and the six 
capitalist ASEAN members have been swept aside with Hanoi's 
market reforms and the signing of the Cambodia peace agreement 
in 1991. 
  Goh said Vietnam's communist ideology was no obstacle to 
membership of the bloc, founded when most of its members were 
aligned against Hanoi during the Vietnam War. 
  "It (Vietnam's communism) should not be an obstacle," he 
said. "It depends on whether it can contribute to ASEAN." 
  Vietnam contends that its political system is not going to 
change anytime soon and that the important thing is stability 
for economic development, a line that fits in nicely with the 
way most ASEAN governments feel about the "soft autocratic" 
style of democracy they practice. 
  Other ASEAN officials have argued that the speed at which 
Vietnam is integrated will depend on the pace of its economic 
development and market reforms While Vietnam is about 30 to 40 
years behind Singapore and possibly some 20 years behind in 
development compared to the Philippines or Indonesia, the wide 
disparity within ASEAN itself would suggest that this is not an 
obstacle. 
  However, ASEAN officials have said that before membership 
can 
be granted, Hanoi must prove its ability to contribute to the 
group's technical projects and resolve administrative and 
financial obstacles. These include the need to boost English 
language skills and accounting practices. 
  Once again it seems ASEAN's ability to zero in on petty 
bureaucratic priorities when faced with the opportunity of 
taking bold action will only reinforce its reputation as a 
hide-bound forum for endless talk and little achievement. 
  Hanoi is upgrading its technical capabilities to accelerate 
its admission but ASEAN continues to talk of admitting Vietnam 
only at an "appropriate time" when it is sure it can make a 
contribution to the regional group. 
  In one frequently cited area, education, it is going to be 
years if not decades before Vietnam can contribute but in 
possibly the most important area -- security -- Vietnam is ready 
to make a valuable contribution now. 
  As Philippines President Fidel Ramos, Hanoi's only strong 
supporter in the regional grouping noted, Vietnam's 
"incorporation into ASEAN is an imperative of Southeast Asian 
peace, security and prosperity." 
  "Over the next generation, Vietnam is certain to become one 
of Southeast Asia's most important states and a major force in 
the balance of power," Ramos said during his recent visit to 
Hanoi. 
  Of particular interest to Ramos and the Philippines is the 
dispute Spratly Islands. ASEAN has been reluctant to take an 
assertive stand on the atolls which are claimed in part by four 
of its members, as well as Vietnam, Taiwan and China and have 
long been regarded as the most likely source of conflict in the 
region. 
  In 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty in which the 
original ASEAN members pledged to settle their disputes 
peacefully. China refuses to sign the treaty and its use of 
force against Vietnam to settle claims in the South China Sea is 
becoming increasingly troubling. 
  ASEAN was born out of fear of the spread of communism and 
conflict from Vietnam. Whether it is a member of ASEAN or not, 
Vietnam remains crucial to continued peace and prosperity in the 
region. 
  By admitting Vietnam, ASEAN will be better placed to work 
toward a solution of the Spratly Islands issue and also prosper 
if the South China Sea can in the words of Ramos, "be 
transformed from waters of contention to an area of cooperation." 
  As ASEAN admits itself, Vietnam's membership is no longer a 
matter of policy or principle but merely procedure and time -- 
an that time has come. <F P=106> [Editorial: "Time Has Come To Admit Vietnam Into ASEAN"] </F>

  [Text] The honor guard at Hanoi's international airport has 
probably never been so busy. Since Washington lifted its 
three-decade-old economic embargo on Vietnam in February, the 
formerly shunned communist bastion has been besieged by 
diplomatic visitors. 
  Leading the rush, have been the heads of the Association of 
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), all eager to look at 
investment prospects and assess Hanoi's ambitions to join their 
privileged group. Within the space of a little over a month, 
Vietnam has hosted visits from the secretary general of ASEAN 
and the leaders of Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. 
  Communist Party chief Du Muoi was a guest of Malaysia last 
week, and President Le Duc Anh is due to visit Indonesia in late 
April. The visits coincide with a diplomatic offensive on the 
part of Vietnam, which is trying to widen ties with ASEAN and 
pave the way for its own entry into the group. 
  The official exchanges mark the second major diplomatic 
offensive Vietnam has launched following the break up of the 
Soviet bloc. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN 
members between October 1991 and July 1992 as Vietnam searched 
for new economic partners. At the time, most observers 
predicted that it would be at least five years before Vietnam 
would be admitted. But in a reflection of the sweeping 
political changes that are occurring across the region, 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced in Hanoi that 
he thought Vietnam may be formally discussed in 18 months. 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos was even more optimistic, 
calling for the immediate acceptance of Vietnam. 
  Political differences between communist Vietnam and the six 
capitalist ASEAN members have been swept aside with Hanoi's 
market reforms and the signing of the Cambodia peace agreement 
in 1991. 
  Goh said Vietnam's communist ideology was no obstacle to 
membership of the bloc, founded when most of its members were 
aligned against Hanoi during the Vietnam War. 
  "It (Vietnam's communism) should not be an obstacle," he 
said. "It depends on whether it can contribute to ASEAN." 
  Vietnam contends that its political system is not going to 
change anytime soon and that the important thing is stability 
for economic development, a line that fits in nicely with the 
way most ASEAN governments feel about the "soft autocratic" 
style of democracy they practice. 
  Other ASEAN officials have argued that the speed at which 
Vietnam is integrated will depend on the pace of its economic 
development and market reforms While Vietnam is about 30 to 40 
years behind Singapore and possibly some 20 years behind in 
development compared to the Philippines or Indonesia, the wide 
disparity within ASEAN itself would suggest that this is not an 
obstacle. 
  However, ASEAN officials have said that before membership 
can 
be granted, Hanoi must prove its ability to contribute to the 
group's technical projects and resolve administrative and 
financial obstacles. These include the need to boost English 
language skills and accounting practices. 
  Once again it seems ASEAN's ability to zero in on petty 
bureaucratic priorities when faced with the opportunity of 
taking bold action will only reinforce its reputation as a 
hide-bound forum for endless talk and little achievement. 
  Hanoi is upgrading its technical capabilities to accelerate 
its admission but ASEAN continues to talk of admitting Vietnam 
only at an "appropriate time" when it is sure it can make a 
contribution to the regional group. 
  In one frequently cited area, education, it is going to be 
years if not decades before Vietnam can contribute but in 
possibly the most important area -- security -- Vietnam is ready 
to make a valuable contribution now. 
  As Philippines President Fidel Ramos, Hanoi's only strong 
supporter in the regional grouping noted, Vietnam's 
"incorporation into ASEAN is an imperative of Southeast Asian 
peace, security and prosperity." 
  "Over the next generation, Vietnam is certain to become one 
of Southeast Asia's most important states and a major force in 
the balance of power," Ramos said during his recent visit to 
Hanoi. 
  Of particular interest to Ramos and the Philippines is the 
dispute Spratly Islands. ASEAN has been reluctant to take an 
assertive stand on the atolls which are claimed in part by four 
of its members, as well as Vietnam, Taiwan and China and have 
long been regarded as the most likely source of conflict in the 
region. 
  In 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty in which the 
original ASEAN members pledged to settle their disputes 
peacefully. China refuses to sign the treaty and its use of 
force against Vietnam to settle claims in the South China Sea is 
becoming increasingly troubling.

   Some wilderness is fine, Hinson says, but you have to stop
somewhere, or at least guarantee some areas for development while
you're locking up others. Idaho, he points out, already has 4
million acres of wilderness _ 7.6 percent of the state.
   Others charge that environmentalists aren't as interested in
biological diversity as they are in creating elitist playgrounds for
wealthy, urban backpackers _ at the expense of local residents
trying to make a living off the public land.
   ``These lands belong to the people. That means all the people,
not a chosen few,'' says Butterfield of the Blue Ribbon Coalition.
   Lynne Stone, raised on an eastern Oregon ranch, says she's no
yuppie backpacker. And there are more ways to make a living off the
land, she adds, than by logging or mining it. Tourism is one of
Idaho's biggest industries, she says, and it's hard to lure tourists
to a clearcut.
   In 20 years, roads have been pushed through more than 8 million
acres of Idaho's wild country, according to the Idaho Conservation
League. ``We're destroying everything that isn't protected,'' Stone
says. ``If we don't set it aside, we'll lose it.''
   Both sides have strong arguments strongly stated _ if not
overstated. In virtually every wilderness debate, we're told the
area in question is a ``crown jewel'' of America's wildlands, to be
saved at all costs. We're also told, by the opposition, that locking
up the land in wilderness would deal the death blow to an already
ailing (pick one) logging, mining, or ranching industry.
   Congress is left to sort it out, and the politics of compromise
leave no one completely satisfied.
   ``It's amazing that this is going to be decided in some room in
the Capitol, 3,000 miles away,'' Stone says. ``It doesn't have
anything to do with Idaho wilderness. It's who owes McClure a favor
at the time.''
   Whatever happens with Idaho, Congress faces enough other
wilderness issues to keep busy for another 25 years.
   It must decide whether 1.5 million acres of tundra in Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is worth more for the caribou that
migrate over it or for the oil reservoirs that may lie under it.
   Battles also loom over vast Bureau of Land Management holdings in
the deserts of Utah, Nevada, California and other Western states.
The BLM has inventoried about 25 million acres of potential
wilderness and is likely to recommend some fraction of that for
designation. The Wilderness Society says it will push for far more.
   Protecting entire ecosystems has become preservationists' latest
rallying cry. They hope to expand existing wilderness areas around
Yellowstone National Park and in the Great Smoky Mountains of North
Carolina and Tennessee.
   Lynne Stone, meanwhile, focuses on her own wild Idaho backyard.
When lobbying, she argues the dollars and cents of tourism. But her
real motives for saving wilderness prove more elusive, more personal.
   In an alpine meadow flushed purple with blooming lupines, Stone
gazes at a horizon of sawtoothed peaks and tries to explain her love
for the land. She talks vaguely of hiking with friends, of the world
she hopes her 11-year-old son will inherit.
   Finally, she settles on words borrowed from a friend who has
guided hunters and fishermen in the wild for years. ``He says they
don't really come for the hunting or fishing. They come for the hush
of the land.''
   A breeze rustles through the whitebark pines and sweeps across
the lupines. A far-off chickadee squeaks out a song. ``That's what
I'm trying to protect,'' Stone says. ``The hush of the land.''

   Congress is left to sort it out, and the politics of compromise
leave no one completely satisfied.
   ``It's amazing that this is going to be decided in some room in
the Capitol, 3,000 miles away,'' Stone says. ``It doesn't have
anything to do with Idaho wilderness. It's who owes McClure a favor
at the time.''
   Whatever happens with Idaho, Congress faces enough other
wilderness issues to keep busy for another 25 years.
   It must decide whether 1.5 million acres of tundra in Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is worth more for the caribou that
migrate over it or for the oil reservoirs that may lie under it.
   Battles also loom over vast Bureau of Land Management holdings in
the deserts of Utah, Nevada, California and other Western states.
The BLM has inventoried about 25 million acres of potential
wilderness and is likely to recommend some fraction of that for
designation. The Wilderness Society says it will push for far more.
   Protecting entire ecosystems has become preservationists' latest
rallying cry. They hope to expand existing wilderness areas around
Yellowstone National Park and in the Great Smoky Mountains of North
Carolina and Tennessee.
   Lynne Stone, meanwhile, focuses on her own wild Idaho backyard.
When lobbying, she argues the dollars and cents of tourism. But her
real motives for saving wilderness prove more elusive, more personal.
   In an alpine meadow flushed purple with blooming lupines, Stone
gazes at a horizon of sawtoothed peaks and tries to explain her love
for the land. She talks vaguely of hiking with friends, of the world
she hopes her 11-year-old son will inherit.
   Finally, she settles on words borrowed from a friend who has
guided hunters and fishermen in the wild for years. ``He says they
don't really come for the hunting or fishing. They come for the hush
of the land.''
   A breeze rustles through the whitebark pines and sweeps across
the lupines. A far-off chickadee squeaks out a song. ``That's what
I'm trying to protect,'' Stone says. ``The hush of the land.''

   Some wilderness is fine, Hinson says, but you have to stop
somewhere, or at least guarantee some areas for development while
you're locking up others. Idaho, he points out, already has 4
million acres of wilderness _ 7.6 percent of the state.
   Others charge that environmentalists aren't as interested in
biological diversity as they are in creating elitist playgrounds for
wealthy, urban backpackers _ at the expense of local residents
trying to make a living off the public land.
   ``These lands belong to the people. That means all the people,
not a chosen few,'' says Butterfield of the Blue Ribbon Coalition.
   Lynne Stone, raised on an eastern Oregon ranch, says she's no
yuppie backpacker. And there are more ways to make a living off the
land, she adds, than by logging or mining it. Tourism is one of
Idaho's biggest industries, she says, and it's hard to lure tourists
to a clearcut.
   In 20 years, roads have been pushed through more than 8 million
acres of Idaho's wild country, according to the Idaho Conservation
League. ``We're destroying everything that isn't protected,'' Stone
says. ``If we don't set it aside, we'll lose it.''
   Both sides have strong arguments strongly stated _ if not
overstated. In virtually every wilderness debate, we're told the
area in question is a ``crown jewel'' of America's wildlands, to be
saved at all costs. We're also told, by the opposition, that locking
up the land in wilderness would deal the death blow to an already
ailing (pick one) logging, mining, or ranching industry.
   Congress is left to sort it out, and the politics of compromise
leave no one completely satisfied.
   ``It's amazing that this is going to be decided in some room in
the Capitol, 3,000 miles away,'' Stone says. ``It doesn't have
anything to do with Idaho wilderness. It's who owes McClure a favor
at the time.''

   Lester Cowan, an independent producer whose
credits include the W.C. Fields comedies ``You Can't Cheat an
Honest Man'' and ``My Little Chickadee,'' died of an apparent heart
attack at 83.
   Cowan, who died at his home on Sunday, was production supervisor
of John Ford's 1935 film ``The Whole Town's Talking,'' starring
Edward G. Robinson and Jean Arthur.
   Four years later he produced the first of his own films, ``You
Can't Cheat an Honest Man,'' and in 1940 made ``My Little
Chickadee,'' which also starred Mae West.
   In the 1940s, he produced ``Commandos Strike at Dawn,''
``Tomorrow the World'' and ``The Story of G.I. Joe.''
   Cowan originated the first college course in film studies in
1929 at the University of Southern California.

   A George Bush aide said Wednesday that Dan
Quayle was asked, before being selected as running mate, whether
strings were pulled to get him into the National Guard and avoid
service in Vietnam. Quayle said none were, the aide recounted.
   ``The question was, I believe, was there any pull or some
influence in some way for him to get into the National Guard. My
impression is the answer is absolutely not,'' Robert Teeter told
reporters.
   ``He, at some point said, `I simply applied, like anyone
else','' said Teeter, who oversaw Bush's vice presidential
selection process.
   Quayle himself, in an interview on CBS, said he was ``almost
certain'' that the governor or lieutenant governor of Indiana were
not asked to help him get in the National Guard in 1969.
   ``Many of us got in,'' he said, adding that he was speaking on
the basis of recollections that are 20 years old.
   At the time, men Quayle's age were being drafted into the Army
and many were sent to Vietnam.
   In an interview with ABC News, Quayle said he chose the National
Guard _ rather than risking the draft _ because that course allowed
him to fulfill his military obligation and still attend law school.
   But if his National Guard unit had been called up _ none were
during the Vietnam War _ he said he ``would have gone and served
very proudly.''
   And he told CNN: ``I was willing and ready to serve my country.
I chose to serve my country in the National Guard like millions of
other people.''
   The question arose as every aspect of Quayle's life came under
intense scrutiny following his surprise selection by Bush Tuesday.
   An NBC-owned Washington, D.C. television station, WRC-TV, said
Quayle ``may have received help from then Indiana Gov. Edgar
Whitcomb.'' Citing Republican sources it did not name, the station
said Quayle was working as an administrative assistant in the
governor's office in 1969 and Whitcomb moved Quayle to the top of a
``lengthy'' waiting list for enrollment in the guard.
   However, Quayle's biography showed that he had not started
working for Whitcomb until 1971, two years after he joined the
National Guard.
   Jeff Nesbit, Quayle press secretary, told of the television
station's report, said: ``I can say nothing more than what he
(Quayle) said. Basically some of the other folks he went to college
with wanted to get in and most of them got in. What he said has to
stand at this time.''

<TEXT>
   Statistics that show Japan's population growth
declining to a postwar low are likely to sharpen fears that lagging
birth rates are weakening the nation's economy.
   Preliminary figures released Friday from Japan's 1990 census
show the nation grew by only 2.1 percent from 1985 to 1990. The 3.4
percent growth from 1980-85 was the previous postwar low.
   The Oct. 1 census counted 123,622,541 people in Japan. The
country is still the world's seventh most populous, but it has one
of the world's slowest growth rates.
   Over the past year, the country has been flooded with magazine,
newspaper and television reports that speak of a ``baby shock.''
Officials express fear that with fewer children, the nation will
eventually have trouble supporting the elderly, a growing
percentage of the population.
   Business leaders say industry is already beginning to feel a
labor shortage.
   Birth rates in Japan have been declining since the introduction
of modern birth control after World War II, according to Dr. Makoto
Atoh, director of the Health and Welfare Ministry's department of
population policy studies.
   A housing shortage, high land prices, rising ages at marriage,
and the soaring costs of education and child-rearing have
contributed to the declining rate, he said.
   ``We think the major cause for the decline is the rising
percentage of singles and the rising age of marriage,'' Atoh said.
   Health and Welfare Ministry figures show that 20 percent of
people in their late 20s were single in 1975, but 37 percent in
that age group were single last year.
   Most women believe the high cost of educating children is the
biggest obstacle to having more, said Dr. Naohiro Ogawa, deputy
director of the Nippon University population research institute,
and the consultant for a recent survey by Mainichi newspaper.
   Another factor is cramped housing conditions and the
astronomical prices of new homes. Mechanization in the home,
expanded education and job opportunities have led an increasing
number of women out of the home.
   Some say the refusal of men to change their roles in the home
discourages large families.
   ``Japanese men don't share housekeeping. All the burden is on
the shoulder of women at home, so it's impossible to have more
children,'' said Mariko Mitsui, a Tokyo city assemblywoman.
   A government policy group has considered revamping maternity
leaves, changing housing policies, and improving child care as
measures to get women to have more children.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, a governing Liberal
Democratic Party leader and a likely future prime minister, caused
an uproar in June when he was quoted as blaming the shrinking birth
rates on the expanded opportunities for higher education for women.
   Hashimoto later denied making the remark.
   Four out of five women questioned in the Mainichi survey said
they opposed government intervention to boost the birth rate, Ogawa
said.

   The Oct. 1 census counted 123,622,541 people in Japan. The
country is still the world's seventh most populous, but it has one
of the world's slowest growth rates.
   Over the past year, the country has been flooded with magazine,
newspaper and television reports that speak of a ``baby shock.''
Officials express fear that with fewer children, the nation will
eventually have trouble supporting the elderly, a growing
percentage of the population.
   Business leaders say industry is already beginning to feel a
labor shortage.
   Birth rates in Japan have been declining since the introduction
of modern birth control after World War II, according to Dr. Makoto
Atoh, director of the Health and Welfare Ministry's department of
population policy studies.
   A housing shortage, high land prices, rising ages at marriage,
and the soaring costs of education and child-rearing have
contributed to the declining rate, he said.
   ``We think the major cause for the decline is the rising
percentage of singles and the rising age of marriage,'' Atoh said.
   Health and Welfare Ministry figures show that 20 percent of
people in their late 20s were single in 1975, but 37 percent in
that age group were single last year.
   Most women believe the high cost of educating children is the
biggest obstacle to having more, said Dr. Naohiro Ogawa, deputy
director of the Nippon University population research institute,
and the consultant for a recent survey by Mainichi newspaper.
   Another factor is cramped housing conditions and the
astronomical prices of new homes. Mechanization in the home,
expanded education and job opportunities have led an increasing
number of women out of the home.
   Some say the refusal of men to change their roles in the home
discourages large families.
   ``Japanese men don't share housekeeping. All the burden is on
the shoulder of women at home, so it's impossible to have more
children,'' said Mariko Mitsui, a Tokyo city assemblywoman.
   A government policy group has considered revamping maternity
leaves, changing housing policies, and improving child care as
measures to get women to have more children.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, a governing Liberal
Democratic Party leader and a likely future prime minister, caused
an uproar in June when he was quoted as blaming the shrinking birth
rates on the expanded opportunities for higher education for women.
   Hashimoto later denied making the remark.
   Four out of five women questioned in the Mainichi survey said
they opposed government intervention to boost the birth rate, Ogawa
said.

  [Text] Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt and Prime 
Minister Paul Keating of Australia visited Vietnam in the first 
fortnight of April. Here is our review of these visits: 
  The two prime ministers came to Vietnam with a view to 
broaden cooperation with Vietnam. The Swedish prime minister 
inaugurated an Ericsson mobile communication system in Vietnam. 
The Ericsson Group of Sweden is a well known manufacturer of 
electronic and telecom equipments. The visit to Vietnam by 
Australian prime minister came after the two countries reached 
an agreement on the construction of My Thuan Bridge crossing the 
Tien River in southern Vietnam. This makes Australia rank the 
first among investors in construction in Vietnam as well as of 
all Indochina. 
  From either side of the Earth, Sweden and Australia have one 
thing in common, that is to contribute to the construction of 
Vietnam infrastructure, one of the most essential needs of 
Vietnam at the present moment. 
  The Australian prime minister also announced $140 million of 
aid to Hanoi to help the latter continue its renovation process. 
Sweden has also so far [word indistinct] granted aid to 
Vietnam. With the visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt, Sweden plans to boost the economic ties with Vietnam. It 
is a new decision taken by Sweden. 
  Both Australian and Swedish leaders acknowledged the 
positive 
results of the ongoing renovation process in Vietnam. The truth 
created by Vietnam itself has urged more countries to invest in 
the country. <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>

L.A. CELEBRATES KING'S CAUSE AT PARADES, RALLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

They marched Monday -- through the streets of South Los Angeles, down the 
boulevards of Beverly Hills, even to a small church in Inglewood -- to protest 
apartheid, to celebrate civil rights and, above all, to honor the memory of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been King's 61st birthday, and Southern Californians celebrated 
the work of the slain civil rights activist by parading down the Los Angeles 
thoroughfare that bears his name, protesting the racism that still exists in 
America and abroad, and effectively shutting down an institution that did not 
close for the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Gray skies hinted of rain, but police estimated that 70,000 people braved the 
chill air to watch the fifth annual King Birthday Parade, which began at the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, wound down King Boulevard and ended, 3.2 miles 
away, at the county Museum of Natural History in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Those words 'we shall overcome' go a long way. They're even saying it in 
Russia," said a smiling Ivan Jones, 73, as he watched his granddaughters march 
in the parade, which attracted a crowd more than three times the size of last 
year's. "It comes from Martin Luther King. Just keep it in your mind that we 
can do it, that we can overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a black governor, and it has nothing to do with the pigmentation 
of his skin," said Keith Strong, 36, referring to Lawrence Douglas Wilder, the 
newly inaugurated governor of Virginia. "It has to do with his ability. That's 
what Martin Luther King was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the sounds of marching bands and high school drill teams were many somber 
and poignant declarations of African-American pride. A woman sold "Do the Right 
Thing" buttons and carried a sign that read "I Love Being Black." Another stood 
in the cool air with a sweat shirt that declared, "I Have Come This Far by 
Faith," and a family baked a special birthday cake for Dr. King and sold pieces 
of it, and other food items, from their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this for his birthday," said Margie Manyweather, who spent a week 
planning and cooking the sweet potato pies, German chocolate cake and barbecued 
chicken her family sold. "What little money I make, I donate to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The image of another civil rights hero, one who has no holiday, also dotted the 
crowd. Gina Temple, 24, kept herself warm in a sweat shirt bearing a likeness 
of Malcolm X, while a vendor nearby sold T-shirts that showed Malcolm X and 
King shaking hands, over the words "Unity Is Strength." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, eventually, it should not be only King's birthday (that we 
celebrate)," said Donyielle Holley, 24. "It should be a day where we celebrate 
all black leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Mayor Tom Bradley rang the City Hall bell as part of a 
nationwide, simultaneous bell-ringing ceremony in honor of King, about 120 
activists gathered in front of Security Pacific National Bank's downtown 
headquarters to protest a corporate decision to open more than 550 of its 
offices, despite the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized that Security Pacific stood alone among banks, we thought 
they should be the focus of a protest," said Susan Anderson of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles. "We are worried that 
the message many businesses and individuals will get because of Security 
Pacific's example is that the holiday is an optional one." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Lewis, a Security Pacific spokeswoman, said that "the sole purpose of 
the decision is to benefit our customers." She added that 20 branches did not 
open Monday, or later decided to close for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After the downtown protest ended, some of the participants drove to Beverly 
Hills to join more than 2,000 students and adult activists demonstrating in 
front of the former South African Consulate offices on Wilshire Boulevard. The 
group then marched along Wilshire to the current consulate on La Cienega 
Boulevard, where they staged a three-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers criticized apartheid in South Africa as well as the racism and 
inequities that they say still exist in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Alfre Woodard, directing her words at South African President Frederik 
W. de Klerk, said, "You are dressing up that tired old whore, apartheid, and 
squiring her out to the ball . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And the shame is that some people in their drunken revelry are willing to 
dance with her, George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bush, how dare you qualify freedom by the color of the people who seek 
it?" Woodard said to the audience that had crowded the steps. She was alluding 
to U.S. support for the social revolution taking place in Eastern Europe while 
ignoring similar struggles in Central America. "That is the dirty secret of our 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the Nation of Islam used the holiday to protest alleged 
Los Angeles police harassment of blacks during a Jan. 3 fight between 24 
officers and 13 Muslims in the Crenshaw District. The incident began after a 
traffic stop and resulted in injuries to several members of each group and the 
arrests of all 13 Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come together in peace," Malik Muhammad, a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Black Man, told a crowd of about 100 at the rally in Leimert Park. "We 
don't have anything against the law. . . . They just didn't approach us in the 
right way, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders have accused police of provoking the disturbance by 
unnecessarily trying to force blacks to lie down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a meeting with police to discuss the concerns, the 13 arrestees -- all 
members of the brotherhood -- face possible felony charges, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Other holiday events Monday included a march in Inglewood that ended with a 
service at the First Church of God. 
</P>
<P>
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Toni Morrison gave the keynote speech at the 
SCLC's 13th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday Dinner at the Bonaventure.

L.A. CELEBRATES KING'S CAUSE AT PARADES, RALLIES

They marched Monday -- through the streets of South Los Angeles, down the 
boulevards of Beverly Hills, even to a small church in Inglewood -- to protest 
apartheid, to celebrate civil rights and, above all, to honor the memory of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been King's 61st birthday, and Southern Californians celebrated 
the work of the slain civil rights activist by parading down the Los Angeles 
thoroughfare that bears his name, protesting the racism that still exists in 
America and abroad, and effectively shutting down an institution that did not 
close for the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Gray skies hinted of rain, but police estimated that 70,000 people braved the 
chill air to watch the fifth annual King Birthday Parade, which began at the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, wound down King Boulevard and ended, 3.2 miles 
away, at the county Museum of Natural History in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Those words 'we shall overcome' go a long way. They're even saying it in 
Russia," said a smiling Ivan Jones, 73, as he watched his granddaughters march 
in the parade, which attracted a crowd more than three times the size of last 
year's. "It comes from Martin Luther King. Just keep it in your mind that we 
can do it, that we can overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a black governor, and it has nothing to do with the pigmentation 
of his skin," said Keith Strong, 36, referring to Lawrence Douglas Wilder, the 
newly inaugurated governor of Virginia. "It has to do with his ability. That's 
what Martin Luther King was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the sounds of marching bands and high school drill teams were many somber 
and poignant declarations of African-American pride. A woman sold "Do the Right 
Thing" buttons and carried a sign that read "I Love Being Black." Another stood 
in the cool air with a sweat shirt that declared, "I Have Come This Far by 
Faith," and a family baked a special birthday cake for Dr. King and sold pieces 
of it, and other food items, from their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this for his birthday," said Margie Manyweather, who spent a week 
planning and cooking the sweet potato pies, German chocolate cake and barbecued 
chicken her family sold. "What little money I make, I donate to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The image of another civil rights hero, one who has no holiday, also dotted the 
crowd. Gina Temple, 24, kept herself warm in a sweat shirt bearing a likeness 
of Malcolm X, while a vendor nearby sold T-shirts that showed Malcolm X and 
King shaking hands, over the words "Unity Is Strength." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, eventually, it should not be only King's birthday (that we 
celebrate)," said Donyielle Holley, 24. "It should be a day where we celebrate 
all black leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Mayor Tom Bradley rang the City Hall bell as part of a 
nationwide, simultaneous bell-ringing ceremony in honor of King, about 120 
activists gathered in front of Security Pacific National Bank's downtown 
headquarters to protest a corporate decision to open more than 550 of its 
offices, despite the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized that Security Pacific stood alone among banks, we thought 
they should be the focus of a protest," said Susan Anderson of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles. "We are worried that 
the message many businesses and individuals will get because of Security 
Pacific's example is that the holiday is an optional one." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Lewis, a Security Pacific spokeswoman, said that "the sole purpose of 
the decision is to benefit our customers." She added that 20 branches did not 
open Monday, or later decided to close for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After the downtown protest ended, some of the participants drove to Beverly 
Hills to join more than 2,000 students and adult activists demonstrating in 
front of the former South African Consulate offices on Wilshire Boulevard. The 
group then marched along Wilshire to the current consulate on La Cienega 
Boulevard, where they staged a three-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers criticized apartheid in South Africa as well as the racism and 
inequities that they say still exist in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Alfre Woodard, directing her words at South African President Frederik 
W. de Klerk, said, "You are dressing up that tired old whore, apartheid, and 
squiring her out to the ball . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And the shame is that some people in their drunken revelry are willing to 
dance with her, George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bush, how dare you qualify freedom by the color of the people who seek 
it?" Woodard said to the audience that had crowded the steps. She was alluding 
to U.S. support for the social revolution taking place in Eastern Europe while 
ignoring similar struggles in Central America. "That is the dirty secret of our 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the Nation of Islam used the holiday to protest alleged 
Los Angeles police harassment of blacks during a Jan. 3 fight between 24 
officers and 13 Muslims in the Crenshaw District. The incident began after a 
traffic stop and resulted in injuries to several members of each group and the 
arrests of all 13 Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come together in peace," Malik Muhammad, a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Black Man, told a crowd of about 100 at the rally in Leimert Park. "We 
don't have anything against the law. . . . They just didn't approach us in the 
right way, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders have accused police of provoking the disturbance by 
unnecessarily trying to force blacks to lie down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a meeting with police to discuss the concerns, the 13 arrestees -- all 
members of the brotherhood -- face possible felony charges, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Other holiday events Monday included a march in Inglewood that ended with a 
service at the First Church of God. 
</P>
<P>
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Toni Morrison gave the keynote speech at the 
SCLC's 13th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday Dinner at the Bonaventure.

Pacific's example is that the holiday is an optional one." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Lewis, a Security Pacific spokeswoman, said that "the sole purpose of 
the decision is to benefit our customers." She added that 20 branches did not 
open Monday, or later decided to close for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After the downtown protest ended, some of the participants drove to Beverly 
Hills to join more than 2,000 students and adult activists demonstrating in 
front of the former South African Consulate offices on Wilshire Boulevard. The 
group then marched along Wilshire to the current consulate on La Cienega 
Boulevard, where they staged a three-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers criticized apartheid in South Africa as well as the racism and 
inequities that they say still exist in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Alfre Woodard, directing her words at South African President Frederik 
W. de Klerk, said, "You are dressing up that tired old whore, apartheid, and 
squiring her out to the ball . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And the shame is that some people in their drunken revelry are willing to 
dance with her, George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bush, how dare you qualify freedom by the color of the people who seek 
it?" Woodard said to the audience that had crowded the steps. She was alluding 
to U.S. support for the social revolution taking place in Eastern Europe while 
ignoring similar struggles in Central America. "That is the dirty secret of our 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the Nation of Islam used the holiday to protest alleged 
Los Angeles police harassment of blacks during a Jan. 3 fight between 24 
officers and 13 Muslims in the Crenshaw District. The incident began after a 
traffic stop and resulted in injuries to several members of each group and the 
arrests of all 13 Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come together in peace," Malik Muhammad, a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Black Man, told a crowd of about 100 at the rally in Leimert Park. "We 
don't have anything against the law. . . . They just didn't approach us in the 
right way, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders have accused police of provoking the disturbance by 
unnecessarily trying to force blacks to lie down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a meeting with police to discuss the concerns, the 13 arrestees -- all 
members of the brotherhood -- face possible felony charges, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Other holiday events Monday included a march in Inglewood that ended with a 
service at the First Church of God.

   Worshipers at Martin Luther King Jr.'s church
were urged today on the slain civil rights leader's birthday to
keep alive his memory and his philosophy of non-violence.
   ``This is a man who is a deep current in our memory,'' said the
Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church in San Francisco. ``Let us live then not only his dream, but
let us live the practice of non-violence and unconditional love.''
   Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at Ebenezer
Baptist Church.
   Church services, parades, and other celebrations were held
nationwide during the weekend before the federal holiday, which for
the first time falls on the slain civil-rights leader's actual
birthday.
   He would have been 61 today.
   Also planned today in Atlanta was a ``March of Celebration''
parade, being televised nationally for the first time.
   A former King lieutenant, the Rev. Hosea Williams, stood in
front of an Atlanta housing project to criticize the day's
activities for making a travesty of King's dream of equality and
justice.
   Williams, King's field organizer in the civil rights movement,
complained that people were starving in the city while thousands of
dollars were being spent on the parade. ``I am really upset with
all this gaiety,'' he said.
   This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats,
apparently racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flareup of
racial tensions in Boston after an apparent hoax in which a white
man had claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife.
   It also comes at a time of gains for blacks _ the election of
David Dinkins, first black mayor of New York City, and the nation's
first elected black governor, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
   ``Today, the sound of libery is being heard all around the
world,'' said James Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial
Equality, as he pounded three times with his fist on the Liberty
Bell in Philadelphia. ``Those who have been denied liberty love it
most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   The New York Stock Exchange held a moment of silence at noon.
   In New Hampshire, one of just four states without some form of
King holiday, about 200 Merrimack Valley High School pupils walked
out of morning classes today in Concord to recognize Martin Luther
King Day, which the school does not observe.
   ``This is our own personal way of remembering him,'' said senior
Mike Krumenacker, one of three pupils who organized the impromptu
gathering of about a third of the school's pupils.
   And in another of the four states, Arizona, thousands marched in
Phoenix and Tucson today to honor King. A racially mixed crowd
carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown
Phoenix as they headed for a rally at the state Capitol.
   King, the son of an Atlanta Baptist minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
   On Sunday, Coretta Scott King delivered her annual ``state of
the dream'' address at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
   King's widow applauded pro-democracy shifts worldwide and said
the civil rights movement would not be deterred by the recent wave
of bombings and threats against blacks. A federal judge and a black
Savannah lawyer were killed in two bombings.
   ``In the last year, we've seen hundreds of thousands of people
marching through the streets of Berlin and Beijing, Budapest and
Pretoria, Moscow, Warsaw and Prague, all singing `We Shall
Overcome' in a host of languages,'' she said.
   ``We're not going to be turned around by letter bombs or threats
or any kind of violence,'' she said. ``Instead, we're going
forward, with unity and courage and commitment.''
   Also in Atlanta, more than 500 students and teachers at Booker
T. Washington High School joined civil rights leader Rosa Parks to
paint a mural dedicated to King. The mural displayed, ``Let Freedom
Ring.''
   In Boston, where blacks have complained about aggressive police
tactics in their search for the killer of a pregnant white woman in
October, about 25 activists planned to demonstrate at a King
memorial breakfast today to protest the presence of Mayor Raymond
Flynn.
   Tensions have been heightened after revelations that Charles
Stuart himself probably killed his wife. He committed suicide this
month.
   ``We don't feel Mayor Flynn should have a seat of honor at this
occasion,'' said Sadiki Kambon, director of a group called the
Community for Human Rights.
   ``The mayor came on the scene that (October) night and was told
by police that an African male killed a white female,'' Kambon
said. ``The mandate was `Get me someone,' and the police proceeded
to roust black males in Mission Hill and the entire city.''
   In New York, Dinkins told about 400 people at Judson Memorial
Church that ``Dr. King took us to the dawn of a new era. It is up
to us to push on into the bright light of day.''
   Wilder, sworn in Saturday, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
David Brinkley'' on Sunday that a black could occupy the White
House ``in our time.''
   In Seattle, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president and co-founder of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, addressed 900 people
Saturday night.
   ``Don't let them make a pious dreamer out of him,'' Lowery said.
``He was a non-violent revolutionary. ... The spirit of Martin
Luther King demands that we be activists.''
   Federal offices were closed today, and most states gave the day
off to their workers as well. The four without any form of King
holiday are Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire, but some
other states kept workers on the job but marked the day in some
other way.

holiday are Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire, but some
other states kept workers on the job but marked the day in some
other way.

   Worshipers at Martin Luther King Jr.'s church
were urged today on the slain civil rights leader's birthday to
keep alive his memory and his philosophy of non-violence.
   ``This is a man who is a deep current in our memory,'' said the
Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church in San Francisco. ``Let us live then not only his dream, but
let us live the practice of non-violence and unconditional love.''
   Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at Ebenezer
Baptist Church.
   Church services, parades, and other celebrations were held
nationwide during the weekend before the federal holiday, which for
the first time falls on the slain civil-rights leader's actual
birthday.
   He would have been 61 today.
   Also planned today in Atlanta was a ``March of Celebration''
parade, being televised nationally for the first time.
   A former King lieutenant, the Rev. Hosea Williams, stood in
front of an Atlanta housing project to criticize the day's
activities for making a travesty of King's dream of equality and
justice.
   Williams, King's field organizer in the civil rights movement,
complained that people were starving in the city while thousands of
dollars were being spent on the parade. ``I am really upset with
all this gaiety,'' he said.
   This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats,
apparently racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flareup of
racial tensions in Boston after an apparent hoax in which a white
man had claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife.
   It also comes at a time of gains for blacks _ the election of
David Dinkins, first black mayor of New York City, and the nation's
first elected black governor, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
   ``Today, the sound of libery is being heard all around the
world,'' said James Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial
Equality, as he pounded three times with his fist on the Liberty
Bell in Philadelphia. ``Those who have been denied liberty love it
most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   The New York Stock Exchange held a moment of silence at noon.
   In New Hampshire, one of just four states without some form of
King holiday, about 200 Merrimack Valley High School pupils walked
out of morning classes today in Concord to recognize Martin Luther
King Day, which the school does not observe.
   ``This is our own personal way of remembering him,'' said senior
Mike Krumenacker, one of three pupils who organized the impromptu
gathering of about a third of the school's pupils.
   And in another of the four states, Arizona, thousands marched in
Phoenix and Tucson today to honor King. A racially mixed crowd
carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown
Phoenix as they headed for a rally at the state Capitol.
   King, the son of an Atlanta Baptist minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
   On Sunday, Coretta Scott King delivered her annual ``state of
the dream'' address at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
   King's widow applauded pro-democracy shifts worldwide and said
the civil rights movement would not be deterred by the recent wave
of bombings and threats against blacks. A federal judge and a black
Savannah lawyer were killed in two bombings.
   ``In the last year, we've seen hundreds of thousands of people
marching through the streets of Berlin and Beijing, Budapest and
Pretoria, Moscow, Warsaw and Prague, all singing `We Shall
Overcome' in a host of languages,'' she said.
   ``We're not going to be turned around by letter bombs or threats
or any kind of violence,'' she said. ``Instead, we're going
forward, with unity and courage and commitment.''
   Also in Atlanta, more than 500 students and teachers at Booker
T. Washington High School joined civil rights leader Rosa Parks to
paint a mural dedicated to King. The mural displayed, ``Let Freedom
Ring.''
   In Boston, where blacks have complained about aggressive police
tactics in their search for the killer of a pregnant white woman in
October, about 25 activists planned to demonstrate at a King
memorial breakfast today to protest the presence of Mayor Raymond
Flynn.
   Tensions have been heightened after revelations that Charles
Stuart himself probably killed his wife. He committed suicide this
month.
   ``We don't feel Mayor Flynn should have a seat of honor at this
occasion,'' said Sadiki Kambon, director of a group called the
Community for Human Rights.
   ``The mayor came on the scene that (October) night and was told
by police that an African male killed a white female,'' Kambon
said. ``The mandate was `Get me someone,' and the police proceeded
to roust black males in Mission Hill and the entire city.''
   In New York, Dinkins told about 400 people at Judson Memorial
Church that ``Dr. King took us to the dawn of a new era. It is up
to us to push on into the bright light of day.''
   Wilder, sworn in Saturday, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
David Brinkley'' on Sunday that a black could occupy the White
House ``in our time.''
   In Seattle, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president and co-founder of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, addressed 900 people
Saturday night.
   ``Don't let them make a pious dreamer out of him,'' Lowery said.
``He was a non-violent revolutionary. ... The spirit of Martin
Luther King demands that we be activists.''
   Federal offices were closed today, and most states gave the day
off to their workers as well. The four without any form of King
holiday are Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire, but some
other states kept workers on the job but marked the day in some
other way.

<TEXT>     Mr. Lee Quarnstrom, I resent your ignorant view you have of Santa Cruz
County . . .;    Dennis Campi; Los Gatos;    Thanks for sharing, Dennis.; We
appreciate the fact that you included our store in your feature article on
shopping in our part of the Santa Cruz Mall. We have no doubts that your
intentions were good, and that you thought that by describing Anubis Warpus as
a "punk" store, you were helping our business . . . We are writing to you
because we feel that you misrepresented the true character of our store . . .
The store has much more to offer, and "punks" constitute a negligible portion
of our clientele . . . Your article has stirred some negative emotions toward
us, since the word "punk" tends to have negative associations, especially
among people who are older and more conservative than ourselves and people who
shop at Anubis.;    Anubis Warpus; Jacek Lentz and Brian Friedman,; owners;
Santa Cruz;  You note in your letter that you sell Dr. Martens shoes, those
favored by punks. I guess I could say, if the shoe fits, wear it. But, since
I'm basically a nice guy, let me merely say that your inventory, which
includes black leather clothing, material on tattooing, lava lamps, etc.,
looks dandy, and I'm sure you're correct when you say that your customers
include grandmothers, students and "young people in general with a taste
somewhat out of the ordinary." Let me also say that what you consider
"somewhat out of the ordinary" seems to this "older and more conservative"
Santa Cruzan to be rather banal. Anyway, best of luck. Meanwhile, let's try to
call it "the Avenue" instead of the Mall.; YOUR column indicates that you have
accepted the Warren Commission's canard that Lee Harvey Oswald murdered John
Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository . . .;   
Iain Prentice; Sunnyvale;    If you'd have been a newspaper reporter for as
long as I have, you, too, might have serious doubts not only about the ability
of the CIA, FBI or U.S. military, whom you say you suspect, to pull off such a
conspiracy, but also to keep everyone involved from blabbing during the past
27-plus years. Also, frankly, more than a quarter-century later, I don't
really care anymore who killed JFK. The man is dead, and a lot of good-headed,
good-hearted political concepts died with him.; THE statement that
"Watsonville is on the brink of disaster" is totally inaccurate and
reprehensible. This city has made great strides in recovery . . . from the
earthquake and agricultural setbacks.;    Anne Lucero; Watsonville;    There
has been a lot of construction on Main Street compared to what's been going on
in Santa Cruz. But I still believe that Green Giant's pullout to Mexico,
coupled with the need for much more rebuilding, present some grave problems
for your town -- where, by the way, I worked for nine years and still visit
frequently.; Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for making my day. No, my
month . . . with your article about bees. I have not laughed so hard for so
long . . . You are truly funny.;    Janice Marklein; San Jose;  I'm passing

has been a lot of construction on Main Street compared to what's been going on

coupled with the need for much more rebuilding, present some grave problems

FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: A motley cast for 'Aida' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY

<TEXT>
There was a motley crew for Verdi's Aida on Wednesday, motlier than I can
remember seeing at the Royal Opera - and that was just the audience, who ran
from American neglige (greying T-shirts, busted chinos) to bold chic
imported from deeply foreign countries. It was a nice touch for the RO to
have imported another motley new cast, unable to communicate with one
another nor even, apparently, with the conductor Edward Downes. I have to
report that by the end, most of the audience were vociferously delighted.
'New cast' is too simple, because the singers successively contracted for
this Aida - Elijah Moshinsky's new production - have been dropping like
flies. Somebody at the RO has had to spend desperate hours on international
phone-lines. Wednesday's Radames, the Icelander Kristjan Johannsson (new to
London), was flown in on the afternoon of the performance: it was no wonder
that he and his Aida seemed never to have been properly introduced.
Of the ex-Soviet singers - not including the Amonasro of Gregory Yurisich,
who is Australian - Nina Rautio's Aida sang in even less intelligible
Italian than Paata Burchuladze's High Priest. Burchuladze, however, lent
imposing power and presence to his faceless role; Miss Rautio, musically
quite effective, kept herself glumly to herself, and her acting to raising
one or both arms heavenward at high notes. It was amusing to watch Dolora
Zajick's Amneris (a daunting Midwestern hostess), Yurisich's wild Amonasro
and Johannsson's stiff, upstanding Radames trying in turn to get some
dramatic response from her, all in vain.
The Zajick mezzo has too sharp an edge for the crucial Act 2 scene with Aida
 -which I have not seen more crudely played: where was Moshinsky?  - but
came into its own with the Act 4 showdown. Johannsson's Italian-schooled
tenor has bright metal and force (he must be a stirring Manrico in
Trovatore), but not much grace. 'Celeste Aida' was brittle, and he kept
rushing his fences - again and again Downes made considerate room for him to
breathe in, but he refused to take it.
Otherwise, Downes himself sounded un-tender with the score, though of course
efficient: grand, noisy ensembles, but no magic in the quieter music. As
usual Moshinsky has built a clean, thrifty production, designed to last; I
thought that recycling Michael Yeargan's Nile act set, with its tall array
of Anubis-heads, for the Act 4 trial looked too much like parsimony. And why
Aida and her father should belong to a genetically deviant tribe of
Ethiopians (none of them was remotely black) remained a mystery: could this
be a perverse example of pc?
In repertory with a variety of singers until July 22

<TEXT>     Color laser printers today are far too costly ($30,000 and up) for personal

foil-like text. LaserColor does, and does it for pennies. Here's how.;   
LaserColor's $14.95 MultiColor Pac contains 10 metallic-color sheets of heat-
and pressure-sensitive film. The film has a patented adhesive that bonds only
to dry toner, the powdered ink used by laser printers and most copying
machines.;    Starting with a printed page from your laser printer or copier,
cut a piece of the film large enough to cover the text or image you want to
color. Then tape the film to the paper with the provided adhesive dots.;   
Next, run the document and the attached film through the laser printer or
copier using the single sheet feed or manual tray. The heat and pressure
activate the film's adhesive, and the metallic color will stick only to the
printed areas.;    Once the paper has passed through the machine, you peel off
the film and adhesive dots. The result is a colored, near-mirror finish added
to the text or image you selected.;    For more information and a free sample,

foil-like text. LaserColor does, and does it for pennies. Here's how.;   
LaserColor's $14.95 MultiColor Pac contains 10 metallic-color sheets of heat-
and pressure-sensitive film. The film has a patented adhesive that bonds only
to dry toner, the powdered ink used by laser printers and most copying
machines.;    Starting with a printed page from your laser printer or copier,
cut a piece of the film large enough to cover the text or image you want to
color. Then tape the film to the paper with the provided adhesive dots.;   
Next, run the document and the attached film through the laser printer or
copier using the single sheet feed or manual tray. The heat and pressure
activate the film's adhesive, and the metallic color will stick only to the
printed areas.;    Once the paper has passed through the machine, you peel off
the film and adhesive dots. The result is a colored, near-mirror finish added
to the text or image you selected.;    For more information and a free sample,

<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An interfaith team of Scripture experts led by a gentle-mannered
Princeton scholar has worked for 15 years producing what's likely
to become the most widely used Bible in American churches.
   The New Revised Standard Version, put out by six publishers in
various editions, is being distributed in May to bookstores. It has
been authorized and commended by most of the nation's major
denominations.
   ``It offers greater accuracy, clarity and naturalness of
expression,'' said the Rev. Bruce M. Metzger, chairman of the
30-member translation committee that turned out the new rendition.
   Drawing on older, more exact manuscripts and changes in meanings
of current English, the work is a fine-tuning of the Revised
Standard Version, completed in 1952, and the most broadly endorsed
version in the years since.
   Metzger, 76, a Presbyterian and courtly, zestful Scripture
scholar of Princeton Theological Seminary, applied this rule in the
new rendering of the ancient texts: ``As literal as possible, as
free as necessary.''
   That demanded that the content adhere to what the original
Hebrew and Greek manuscripts actually say, while phrasing it in
understandable and graceful English.
   ``We never tampered with meanings,'' Metzger said in an
interview. But many archaic usages and sometimes ambiguous or
obscure passages are clarified in the revised translation.
   For example, Zechariah 3:3, previously rendered as ``Now Joshua
was standing before the angel, clothed in filthy garments,''
becomes: ``Now Joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood
before the angel.''
   The NRSV was produced under auspices of the National Council of
Churches, which also holds the copyright on the predecessor RSV,
endorsed by most major Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox churches.
   Despite the contemporary proliferation of Bible translations,
Metzger said the RSV has been the mostly widely used ``modern
speech translation.'' In its 38 years, it has sold more than 45
million copies.
   Revising of it was done by a translation committee of
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish scholars.
   Biblical scholars these days ``approach each other in terms of
scholarshilp,'' not denomination, Metzger said. ``There's a
homogeneity in biblical scholarship the likes of which we had not
seen before.
   ``The differences are in theology, not in biblical studies.
Irrespective of denominational affiliations, matters of theological
interpretation fall into the background. So far as the book goes,
we are essentially one.''
   Most teams producing Bible translations are paid for their work,
but the NRSV group labored at their task since 1974 without pay or
share in royalties. It's ``a contribution'' to the churches,
Metzger said.
   Formal publication date and church celebrations of it were
scheduled in September, but a May 1 start was authorized for
distribution to stores.
   While some feminists pressed for more sexually inclusive
language in the new translation, Metzger's criteria required
adherence to the texts. However, many terms previously rendered as
male were originally inclusive.
   He said that masculine pronouns or the words ``man'' or ``men''
often were used previously in passages in which the original text
allows for more generic usage such as ``one'' or ``people.''
   For example, Matthew 6:30 previously was rendered ``O men of
little faith,'' but now is rendered, ``you of little faith.''
Metzger said the word for man wasn't present in the original.
   Similarly, John 12:32 previously was rendered, ``And I when I am
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.'' The latter
phrase now becomes, ``...draw all people to myself.''
   However, pronouns referring to God and Jesus remain masculine.
``We were not authorized to change them,'' Metzger said, adding
that there was no ``tampering with the gender of deity.
   ``God remains `Our Father,' and Jesus Christ is the Son of God.''
   However, uses of ``thee'' and ``thou'' in addressing God are
changed to ``you.'' ``In the Hebrew and Greek texts the same form
of the second person pronoun is used in talking to God and
people,'' Metzger said.
   He calls the new translation both ``the newest and oldest
version'' since the translators used ancient texts only recently
discovered, such as the Dead Sea scrolls providing much older
manuscripts of the Old Testament.
   Some previously rendered passages that sometimes drew snickers
in church readings were changed to correct possible
misunderstandings.
   For instance, Psalm 50:9, that previously read, ``I will accept
no bull from your house,'' becomes, ``I will not accept a bull from
your house.'
   Also, Paul's letter in Second Corinthians ll:25 previously read,
``Once I was stoned.'' It now reads, ``Once I received a stoning.''
   Publishers distributing the NRSV are Cambridge University Press,
Thomas Nelson Publishers, Inc., Holman Bible Publishers, Oxford
University Press, World Bible Publishers, Inc., and Zondervan
Corporation.
   In addition, the American Bible Society has been authorized to
offer the NRSV as part of its program, and Collins Ltd., is
publishing an edition in Great Britain.

   He said that masculine pronouns or the words ``man'' or ``men''
often were used previously in passages in which the original text
allows for more generic usage such as ``one'' or ``people.''
   For example, Matthew 6:30 previously was rendered ``O men of
little faith,'' but now is rendered, ``you of little faith.''
Metzger said the word for man wasn't present in the original.
   Similarly, John 12:32 previously was rendered, ``And I when I am
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.'' The latter
phrase now becomes, ``...draw all people to myself.''
   However, pronouns referring to God and Jesus remain masculine.
``We were not authorized to change them,'' Metzger said, adding
that there was no ``tampering with the gender of deity.
   ``God remains `Our Father,' and Jesus Christ is the Son of God.''
   However, uses of ``thee'' and ``thou'' in addressing God are
changed to ``you.'' ``In the Hebrew and Greek texts the same form
of the second person pronoun is used in talking to God and
people,'' Metzger said.
   He calls the new translation both ``the newest and oldest
version'' since the translators used ancient texts only recently
discovered, such as the Dead Sea scrolls providing much older
manuscripts of the Old Testament.
   Some previously rendered passages that sometimes drew snickers
in church readings were changed to correct possible
misunderstandings.
   For instance, Psalm 50:9, that previously read, ``I will accept
no bull from your house,'' becomes, ``I will not accept a bull from
your house.'
   Also, Paul's letter in Second Corinthians ll:25 previously read,
``Once I was stoned.'' It now reads, ``Once I received a stoning.''

<HEAD>New Rendering of Widely Used Bible Version Now Ready</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An interfaith team of Scripture experts led by a gentle-mannered
Princeton scholar has worked for 15 years producing what's likely
to become the most widely used Bible in American churches.
   The New Revised Standard Version, put out by six publishers in
various editions, is being distributed in May to bookstores. It has
been authorized and commended by most of the nation's major
denominations.
   ``It offers greater accuracy, clarity and naturalness of
expression,'' said the Rev. Bruce M. Metzger, chairman of the
30-member translation committee that turned out the new rendition.
   Drawing on older, more exact manuscripts and changes in meanings
of current English, the work is a fine-tuning of the Revised
Standard Version, completed in 1952, and the most broadly endorsed
version in the years since.
   Metzger, 76, a Presbyterian and courtly, zestful Scripture
scholar of Princeton Theological Seminary, applied this rule in the
new rendering of the ancient texts: ``As literal as possible, as
free as necessary.''
   That demanded that the content adhere to what the original
Hebrew and Greek manuscripts actually say, while phrasing it in
understandable and graceful English.
   ``We never tampered with meanings,'' Metzger said in an
interview. But many archaic usages and sometimes ambiguous or
obscure passages are clarified in the revised translation.
   For example, Zechariah 3:3, previously rendered as ``Now Joshua
was standing before the angel, clothed in filthy garments,''
becomes: ``Now Joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood
before the angel.''
   The NRSV was produced under auspices of the National Council of
Churches, which also holds the copyright on the predecessor RSV,
endorsed by most major Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox churches.
   Despite the contemporary proliferation of Bible translations,
Metzger said the RSV has been the mostly widely used ``modern
speech translation.'' In its 38 years, it has sold more than 45
million copies.
   Revising of it was done by a translation committee of
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish scholars.
   Biblical scholars these days ``approach each other in terms of
scholarshilp,'' not denomination, Metzger said. ``There's a
homogeneity in biblical scholarship the likes of which we had not
seen before.
   ``The differences are in theology, not in biblical studies.
Irrespective of denominational affiliations, matters of theological
interpretation fall into the background. So far as the book goes,
we are essentially one.''
   Most teams producing Bible translations are paid for their work,
but the NRSV group labored at their task since 1974 without pay or
share in royalties. It's ``a contribution'' to the churches,
Metzger said.
   Formal publication date and church celebrations of it were
scheduled in September, but a May 1 start was authorized for
distribution to stores.
   While some feminists pressed for more sexually inclusive
language in the new translation, Metzger's criteria required
adherence to the texts. However, many terms previously rendered as
male were originally inclusive.
   He said that masculine pronouns or the words ``man'' or ``men''
often were used previously in passages in which the original text
allows for more generic usage such as ``one'' or ``people.''
   For example, Matthew 6:30 previously was rendered ``O men of
little faith,'' but now is rendered, ``you of little faith.''
Metzger said the word for man wasn't present in the original.
   Similarly, John 12:32 previously was rendered, ``And I when I am
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.'' The latter
phrase now becomes, ``...draw all people to myself.''
   However, pronouns referring to God and Jesus remain masculine.
``We were not authorized to change them,'' Metzger said, adding
that there was no ``tampering with the gender of deity.
   ``God remains `Our Father,' and Jesus Christ is the Son of God.''
   However, uses of ``thee'' and ``thou'' in addressing God are
changed to ``you.'' ``In the Hebrew and Greek texts the same form
of the second person pronoun is used in talking to God and
people,'' Metzger said.
   He calls the new translation both ``the newest and oldest

manuscripts of the Old Testament.

no bull from your house,'' becomes, ``I will not accept a bull from
your house.'

``Once I was stoned.'' It now reads, ``Once I received a stoning.''

   New Paltz, N.Y. -- They are the denizens of ancient Greece
in the years following the death of Alexander the Great:
elegantly draped and coiffed women, a staid young soldier in
short tunic and thick-rimmed hat, a pair of young women
playing a jacks-like game of "knucklebones," two cherubic
boys gleefully staging a cockfight, a sagging old nurse
cradling her infant charge, a dancing dwarf.
   Meet these people -- or rather miniature clay depictions
of them -- in an exquisite exhibition mounted by the College
Art Gallery at the State University of New York campus here.

   The 52 works in this small but ambitious show, titled "The
Coroplast's Art: Greek Terracottas of the Hellenistic World,"
show ancient Greece in a more intimate light than those
familiar monumental sculptures of Zeus and Aphrodite in
marble. The terracottas give us a glimpse of the life of the
common people -- their clothing, religious beliefs,
amusements, and even the diseases they fell prey to.
   During the Hellenistic period (323 B.C. to 31 B.C.), Greek
civilization dominated the Mediterranean basin north and
south. Trade boomed, as did royal and private patronage of
the arts. But the vastness of Alexander's empire, and then
its collapse after his death, "fostered a feeling of
smallness and inconsequence for individuals," curator Jaimee
P. Uhlenbrock writes in the introduction to the show's
catalog.
   Sculptors responded, she explains, by emphasizing everyday
human experiences and emotions, "in contrast to the
extraordinary behavior of gods and heroes." The resulting
figurines, from a few inches to a couple of feet in height,
became extremely popular. They were offered to the deities at
temples and in home sanctuaries and were placed in graves to
scare away evil spirits, pay tribute to a particular god or
maybe just to keep the deceased company on his or her trip
into the afterlife. They also may have been used for purely
decorative purposes in the home, says Ms. Uhlenbrock, an
associate professor of classical art and archaeology here.
She organized the show in honor of the 90th birthday of
Dorothy Burr Thompson, who pioneered the study of these
sculptures.
   The figurines were mass-produced by artists called
coroplasts, who were influenced by the talented bronze and
silver craftsmen and potters they worked alongside. To make a
figurine, the coroplast pressed moist clay into a pair of
molds, one for the front of the figurine, one for the back.
He used as many as 14 accessory molds depending on the
complexity of the statue. After the various pieces were
assembled, the statue was fired in a kiln, coated with gypsum
and painted.
   Variations in texture and clay color (cream to peach to
grayish brown) help pinpoint where the figurines were made.
The show focuses on six centers: Athens, Tanagra and Corinth
on the Greek mainland; Myrina and Smyrna on the coast of Asia
Minor (now Turkey); and Taras in southern Italy.
   The most well-known figurines are those in the Tanagra
style (which actually originated in Athens), heavily draped
women in serene standing or seated positions. Some can be
identified as women of means by their "melon" hairdo, a
series of twists or braids brought into a large bun at the
back of the head.
   Also typical of the Greek mainland are "personality
figures" -- dwarfs, aged nurses and contemplative old men.
Theatrical motifs were common as well: One statue of a boy
carrying a mask probably is a participant in a dramatic
festival in honor of the god Dionysus. Though the mask is
broken off at the bottom, we can still see that one eyebrow
is raised, the other relaxed. Ms. Uhlenbrock points out that
this was a common stage convention: The actor evinced a
particular mood by turning the appropriate side of the mask
toward the audience.
   Another delightful theatrical figurine from this region
shows an actor wearing the mask of a courtesan, so identified
by its flamelike "lampadion" (little torch) hairstyle. The
mouth of the mask is open and the tongue sticks out, possibly
indicating that this was a speaking part. A similar miniature
mask comes from Myrina, across the Aegean Sea in Asia Minor.
It was probably sold at souvenir stalls near the theater; a
large loop at the top would allow it to be worn as a pendant.
   In the figurines from Asia Minor, Ms. Uhlenbrock sees "a
culmination of fantasy and sensuality." Witness a beautiful
flying Nike from Myrina, circa 180 B.C. This winged goddess
of victory wears a transparent, high-belted gown, her right
breast and left leg exposed. She is attributed to ananonymous
crafts man known as the coroplast of the victories, and was
meant to be suspended from the ceiling. "Notice the delicacy
of the work," says Ms. Thompson. "The Greeks had a wonderful
sense of restraint. They didn't overdo. Every little detail
was thoughtfully and delicately worked out."
   Not only did the coroplasts of Myrina give us
less-inhibited depictions of the female body, their
counterparts in nearby Smyrna began to sculpt -- often with
amazing clinical accuracy -- images of the physically
deformed. Some scholars hypothesize such people may have
journeyed to a medical college at Smyrna for treatment, where
the coroplasts could have seen them in the streets begging or
performing. Ms. Uhlenbrock's favorite work falls in this cate

   New Paltz, N.Y. -- They are the denizens of ancient Greece
in the years following the death of Alexander the Great:
elegantly draped and coiffed women, a staid young soldier in
short tunic and thick-rimmed hat, a pair of young women
playing a jacks-like game of "knucklebones," two cherubic
boys gleefully staging a cockfight, a sagging old nurse
cradling her infant charge, a dancing dwarf.
   Meet these people -- or rather miniature clay depictions
of them -- in an exquisite exhibition mounted by the College
Art Gallery at the State University of New York campus here.
It's up until March 15, and then at Harvard's Arthur M.
Sackler Museum from May 26 through July 28.

   The 52 works in this small but ambitious show, titled "The
Coroplast's Art: Greek Terracottas of the Hellenistic World,"
show ancient Greece in a more intimate light than those
familiar monumental sculptures of Zeus and Aphrodite in
marble. The terracottas give us a glimpse of the life of the
common people -- their clothing, religious beliefs,
amusements, and even the diseases they fell prey to.
   During the Hellenistic period (323 B.C. to 31 B.C.), Greek
civilization dominated the Mediterranean basin north and
south. Trade boomed, as did royal and private patronage of
the arts. But the vastness of Alexander's empire, and then
its collapse after his death, "fostered a feeling of
smallness and inconsequence for individuals," curator Jaimee
P. Uhlenbrock writes in the introduction to the show's
catalog.
   Sculptors responded, she explains, by emphasizing everyday
human experiences and emotions, "in contrast to the
extraordinary behavior of gods and heroes." The resulting
figurines, from a few inches to a couple of feet in height,
became extremely popular. They were offered to the deities at
temples and in home sanctuaries and were placed in graves to
scare away evil spirits, pay tribute to a particular god or
maybe just to keep the deceased company on his or her trip
into the afterlife. They also may have been used for purely
decorative purposes in the home, says Ms. Uhlenbrock, an
associate professor of classical art and archaeology here.
She organized the show in honor of the 90th birthday of
Dorothy Burr Thompson, who pioneered the study of these
sculptures.
   The figurines were mass-produced by artists called
coroplasts, who were influenced by the talented bronze and
silver craftsmen and potters they worked alongside. To make a
figurine, the coroplast pressed moist clay into a pair of
molds, one for the front of the figurine, one for the back.
He used as many as 14 accessory molds depending on the
complexity of the statue. After the various pieces were
assembled, the statue was fired in a kiln, coated with gypsum
and painted.
   Variations in texture and clay color (cream to peach to
grayish brown) help pinpoint where the figurines were made.
The show focuses on six centers: Athens, Tanagra and Corinth
on the Greek mainland; Myrina and Smyrna on the coast of Asia
Minor (now Turkey); and Taras in southern Italy.
   The most well-known figurines are those in the Tanagra
style (which actually originated in Athens), heavily draped
women in serene standing or seated positions. Some can be
identified as women of means by their "melon" hairdo, a
series of twists or braids brought into a large bun at the
back of the head.
   Also typical of the Greek mainland are "personality
figures" -- dwarfs, aged nurses and contemplative old men.
Theatrical motifs were common as well: One statue of a boy
carrying a mask probably is a participant in a dramatic
festival in honor of the god Dionysus. Though the mask is
broken off at the bottom, we can still see that one eyebrow
is raised, the other relaxed. Ms. Uhlenbrock points out that
this was a common stage convention: The actor evinced a
particular mood by turning the appropriate side of the mask
toward the audience.
   Another delightful theatrical figurine from this region
shows an actor wearing the mask of a courtesan, so identified
by its flamelike "lampadion" (little torch) hairstyle. The
mouth of the mask is open and the tongue sticks out, possibly
indicating that this was a speaking part. A similar miniature
mask comes from Myrina, across the Aegean Sea in Asia Minor.
It was probably sold at souvenir stalls near the theater; a
large loop at the top would allow it to be worn as a pendant.
   In the figurines from Asia Minor, Ms. Uhlenbrock sees "a
culmination of fantasy and sensuality." Witness a beautiful
flying Nike from Myrina, circa 180 B.C. This winged goddess
of victory wears a transparent, high-belted gown, her right
breast and left leg exposed. She is attributed to ananonymous
crafts man known as the coroplast of the victories, and was
meant to be suspended from the ceiling. "Notice the delicacy
of the work," says Ms. Thompson. "The Greeks had a wonderful
sense of restraint. They didn't overdo. Every little detail
was thoughtfully and delicately worked out."
   Not only did the coroplasts of Myrina give us
less-inhibited depictions of the female body, their
counterparts in nearby Smyrna began to sculpt -- often with

journeyed to a medical college at Smyrna for treatment, where

on the Danube?"] 
  [Text] According to the Moldovan mass media, the 
government of that country does everything possible to promote 
the creation of its own merchant fleet on the Danube. For that 
purpose, not only are negotiations conducted with the CIS 
countries on the fair division of the former Union's fleet, but 
possibilities are also sought to purchase, build, and charter 
vessels. A shipping company -- "Moldova Shipping Company" -- 
was recently created there. It already has seven vessels at its 
disposal: three passenger ships, three freight vessels, and a 
barge. All of them have been chartered from Romanian ship 
owners and are, for the time being, kept in the Romanian port of 
Constanta. However, in the near future, our neighbors will 
start building a port on the Danube, where the Moldovan 
territory is adjacent to the river. 
  It looks like the Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company will 
have 
yet another competitor. At any rate, it will take care of the 
cargo from Moldova itself. <F P=106> [Report by Heorhiy Vorotnyuk from Odessa: "A New Competitor </F>
